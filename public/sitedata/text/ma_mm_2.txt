"Where do we put your hat? Yes, we will put it on your head"

<tagline>
Your baby learns about the parts of her body by naming and touching them.

<takeaway>
Your baby will become more aware of herself as she learns the names of her body parts. 

<overview>
Learning about her body helps a baby understand what makes her an individual. This strengthens her identity. It also helps her to see how she is similar to other people.

<practice>
Encourage Mom to touch parts of her baby’s body and name them in different contexts throughout the day. She can then guide her baby to touch her own body, by saying, for example, "It’s cold outside! Feel how cold my cheeks are.” She can read the book Hand, Hand, Fingers, Thumb by Dr. Seuss and sing Head and Shoulders Knees and Toes to help her baby identify body parts.

Eventually, her baby will be able to find the parts of her body on her own. Mom can hand her a cloth and say, "Can you wipe your cheeks, please?” Remind Mom to give her baby time to think it through to see if she understands where her cheeks are.

<reflection>
Which body parts do you already talk about regularly with your baby? 
How can you casually teach her about body parts while narrating what you are doing?
How can you take what your baby already knows and challenge her a little?

"You are rocking your baby to sleep."

<tagline>
Give your baby toys that allow her to mimic the people around her. 

<takeaway>
Your baby notices what people around her are doing. Then she starts to imitate their actions when she plays. 

<overview>
Between 12 and 18 months, a baby starts to engage in pretend play. Parents/caregivers might notice that their baby’s play is a simple imitation of what she has seen other people doing. She pretends to talk on the phone, take the dog for a walk or stir a pot on the stove. Babies use the memory of what they see to direct their play.

<practice>
While cooking dinner, suggest that Mom offer her baby a pot and a spoon to play with so they can "cook” together. When a baby has safe, real-life objects to play with, it encourages her to be involved in this type of play.

Mom can join in with her baby while she is pretending. Mom can pick up a banana and pretend it is a phone or offer her baby a blanket when she is rocking her dolly. When her baby puts out a cup, Mom can say, "Can I have some tea?” Talk about what she is doing, by saying, for example, "Mmmm, you are cooking supper; it smells so good,” and offer her toys or other household items that she can use while she pretends, by saying, for example, "Here is a cookbook to look at while you are cooking.”

Encourage Mom to talk out loud about what is happening; this helps her baby notice some potential play ideas. For example, she can say, "I’m going to drive the car; I need to turn the key to make the car go.” Or, "These dishes need to go in the cupboard.” Her baby might also be interested in acting out what she sees in her favourite books and stories.

"You are going all the way to the top!"

<tagline>
Give your baby chances to practise moving her whole body.

<takeaway>
Your baby gains strength and confidence when she engages in active play. 

<overview>
Shortly after a baby starts walking, she will become curious about all the other things her body can do. She will gain more and more control over her body and will want to practise her new skills as often as possible. Once a baby starts climbing on furniture around the house, she is showing that she is ready to build strength in her big muscles. This is a good example of how her behaviour lets you know what she needs. She needs to use her arms to pull her body up and her legs to move her body around and she is enjoying the thrill of mastering a new skill.

<practice>
Encourage Mom to set up opportunities for her baby to climb and slide. Visit a nearby playground and encourage her to try the slide and climbing structure. At home, lean the couch cushions against the couch so she can slide down to the floor. Allow her to go up and down the stairs. Tell Mom that her baby might not be interested in what is at the top or the bottom of the stairs. She just needs to climb.

Mom can talk to her baby about what she is doing by saying, "You are climbing so high." Instead of restricting movement or promoting caution, Mom can help baby pay attention to where she is and what she is doing. Saying, "You are getting high. How will you come down?” will help guide her to climb safely and become confident in her body movements. Or, Mom can offer encouragement by saying, "There is a rung just below your foot. Can you reach it?”

Meaningful Moments | 4

<title>

<quotation>
"The sun is shining today, let’s go check on our vegetables."

<tagline>
Give your baby plenty of chances to explore the outdoors.

<takeaway>
Your child will gain an appreciation for the land when she is given the opportunity to play in nature.

<overview>
Being outdoors relieves stress and makes both adults and babies feel calmer. When a baby spends a lot of time outdoors, her physical development will improve and she will have a healthier immune system.

Babies gain a respect for nature when parents/caregivers model how to appropriately interact with the land. Gardening, fishing, bonfires, picking berries or medicine and tobogganing are all activities that show a baby what the outdoor world has to offer. Simple activities close to home—like going for walks, shoveling snow, playing with a ball outside, having a picnic or going for afternoon naps in the backyard—are a great way to get to know the outdoors. Many indoor activities can be done outdoors too. Colouring, books, blocks, dolls and cars are all examples of typical indoor activities that are equally fun when played outside.

When a baby is dressed appropriately for the weather, she will be comfortable and want to spend more time outside. When spending time outdoors is fun and exciting, parents/caregivers will find that their baby will prefer it to being inside or watching TV.

<practice>
Encourage Mom to spend quality time with her baby outdoors. This will inspire her baby’s natural curiosity. Mom can show her something new, ask her questions and offer explanations for things she is curious about. Mom might choose to provide her baby with tools to help her to explore the outdoors, such as a bucket, shovel, jar, a magnifying glass or net.

"Let’s walk up the stairs, one, two, three!"

<tagline>
Count out loud with your baby.

<takeaway>
Your baby will hear numbers used in sequence, which will help her learn to count. 

<overview>
The first step in learning to count is hearing and remembering the order of numbers. Later, a baby starts to match the number 1 with one item or 2 with two items. To start, saying the numbers out loud is enough. 

<practice>
Explain to Mom that finding ways to count with her baby during the day helps her learn. The more she hears and uses numbers, the more she will understand them and find them helpful. Mom can count her baby’s fingers and toes in the bath or count how many pieces of apple she has on her plate.

When going down a slide, Mom can help her baby get ready by saying, "One, two, three!” She can prompt her baby by saying, "Help me count, okay? Ready, one, two...” and let her fill in the blank.

Remind Mom that there will be times when her baby says the numbers out of order or pronounces them incorrectly. This is her baby showing that she knows where a number goes and, with practise, she will name the right number. Staying positive will encourage her to continue counting. Laughing or making her feel silly can discourage her from trying.

"The kitty cat says Meow."

<tagline>
Talk about animals and the sounds they make.

<takeaway>
Your baby learns about animals and the natural world while playing with the sounds of everyday language. 

<overview>
Animals appeal to babies. Whether they are real animals or toys, pictures or cartoons, many children are curious about the role that animals have in their lives. Some researchers believe that interacting with animals helps children develop empathy and compassion and that learning about animals from a young age connects children to nature.

<practice>
Point out to Mom that toys and books offer many opportunities to talk about animals and the sounds they make. As Mom plays or reads with her baby, she can look for naturally occurring moments to notice animals, saying things like, "Look at the puppy. Ruff ruff ruff.” Mom can also draw her baby’s attention to animals in the home, on TV or in the community, helping her see that animals come in many shapes, sizes and environments.

"I’m hiding Nikoa, can you find me?"

<tagline>
Encourage your baby to use her whole body to look for something.

<takeaway>
Your baby can move around when she looking for something, which adds more excitement to hide and seek games. 

<overview>
Babies enjoy solving problems, such as finding a missing object or person. As they develop new motor skills, they can search in bigger spaces, which opens up new possibilities. 

<practice>
Encourage Mom to give her baby opportunities to look for toys or to play hide and seek with her.

Find a space where she has a lot of room to move and explore safely. Place her favourite toy inside a box. Cover the box with a blanket and say, "Goodbye." Then take the blanket off and say, "Hello." Tell Mom to repeat this. At first, she can leave a piece of the toy sticking out from under the blanket to give her baby a little help. As her baby gains confidence in the game, Mom can cover the toy completely.

Her baby will love searching for people as well. Tell Mom to go around a corner and call out to her baby to come and find her. Give her a lot of praise when she does.

<quotation>
"Your boat is floating on top of the water."

<tagline>
Give your baby a bucket of water and some toys. Let her experiment with which ones sink and which ones float.

<takeaway>
Sink and float allows your baby to practise solving problems through experimentation.

<overview>
Sink and float is an early science concept. Babies learn about weight when they see that heavy objects sink and light objects float. While playing with objects in water, babies begin to understand that differences in weight cause a different effect.

<practice>
Discuss playing sink and float. Mom can fill up a large tub of water or play in the bathtub with her baby, offering her various objects to play with. Cups, ladles, rubber duckies, smooth rocks, toy cars and boats are fun to play with in the tub. Mom can show her baby how some items float and some sink. Mom can pull the rubber duck down to the bottom of the tub and let it pop back up, then show enthusiasm and excitement, saying, "Pop! That floated all the way up to the top! Can you try?” Her baby will be pleased to try a new experiment. "Does your toy car float to the top? Wow! Your car went all the way down to the bottom. Does anything else sink to the bottom?”

"You put the red block on top of the green block."

<tagline>
Offer your baby materials to play and build with.

<takeaway>
Your baby will use her hands and fingers to build and stack small objects. 

<overview>
A baby practises small or fine motor skills when she builds with blocks. She learns about size, weight, balance and stability, especially when parents/caregivers talk about the blocks while she is playing.

A baby practises trial and error when she plays with blocks. For example, if her tower falls down, she tries again, perhaps using a different strategy this time.

<practice>
Encourage Mom to provide her baby with blocks in a variety of sizes and shapes; she can line them up in a row, stack them on top of each other or knock them over. Mom can use descriptive words as she shows her baby how to stack them and encourage her to try by saying, "I’m putting the blue one on top of this big yellow block. Can you put this red one on top?” Mom can provide her with many different items to build with, such as empty boxes or plastic containers.

Nesting

Meaningful Moments | 10

<title>
kâwawîyesit pâkahtôwan têpisin wâtihkanihk

<quotation>
"The circle ball fits into the circle hole!"

<tagline>
Let your baby experiment with how items fit together.

<takeaway>
Your baby uses her hand–eye coordination and problem-solving skills to fit objects together. 

<overview>
Exploring how shapes fit inside each other is both a puzzle and an early simple math skill for a baby. As she practises problem-solving strategies, she develops the small muscles in her hands and her hand–eye coordination. Nesting toys increase her awareness of spaces. She has to look at a piece, judge its size and shape, decide where it should go and make it fit. This simple activity provides her with the opportunity to learn many skills at the same time.

<practice>
Encourage Mom to introduce her baby to a nesting toy. She can tell her baby about the shapes she is holding, saying "You're holding an apple; that apple is round.” Mom does not have to give her baby the correct action or even expect her to understand how to use the nesting puzzle on her first try. Offering a hint might help her make the connection on her own, such as, "That cup is round and this muffin tin is round.”

This activity can be done using items from around the house, such as pots and pans, plastic containers, cups or muffin tins. Mom can use a muffin tin and various round objects, such as an apple, a ball and a cup, for her baby to try nesting. As she gets better at this activity, Mom can offer her containers with lids. Describing the various shapes and narrating her actions will help her baby learn "round, square, big, little.”

Action Words

<title>
kahkî wîci kwâskôhtimin kwâskôhtih kwâskôhtih

<quotation>
"Can you hop with me? Hop, hop, hop!"

<tagline>
Use words to describe your baby’s movements.

<takeaway>
Using language to describe your baby’s actions will help her be more aware of her own body. 

<overview>
The more language a baby hears, the more she understands and the better she will be at communicating as she gets older. Any type of play—including active play—can provide an opportunity for her to learn language. As parents/caregivers use words to describe what their baby is doing, she will become more aware of her body. This helps her to understand her abilities. Describing her actions can also help her to become more aware of her successes. Doing a movement while hearing the word for it helps her get a deeper understanding of what that word means.

<practice>
As Mom sees her baby play and move her body, she can describe her baby’s actions. Some examples could be, run, hop, jump, pull, push, tiptoe, crawl or skip. Mom can say the word to her baby as she is moving, "You’re crawling so fast!”

In everyday situations, suggest to Mom that she provide her baby with descriptions of how she is moving or give her a clear description of how to move in a particular situation. For example, Mom can say, "Let’s tiptoe to your room so we don’t wake up your sister. Tip ... toe ... tip .... toe.” When Mom uses descriptive words, she can give her baby positive feedback about how she is growing, such as, "Last week you were jumping with one foot and now you just used two feet to jump! Can you jump all the way over to me? Jump, jump, jump!”

<title>
cêskwa kipêhtên cî wâyawîtimihk êhayat âhasiw

<quotation>
"Wait! Do you hear that? There’s a crow outside."

<tagline>
Point out and name sounds that occur throughout the day.

<takeaway>
Your baby becomes curious and more aware of her surroundings when you talk about the sounds she hears.

<overview>
Connecting sounds with words requires a baby to use her memory to remember something that she cannot see. This helps her be present in nature. Listening takes time and deep thought. It also takes practise. Intentionally listening to something does not come easily because a baby has to stop what she is doing and wait for a sound. Waiting for something to happen is a good way to learn about delayed gratification—that results do not always happen right away. This skill is important for later learning as well as for developing social skills.

<practice>
Encourage Mom to help her baby listen to sounds in the world. While on a walk, Mom could stop and point out a sound. She can show her baby she is listening by cupping her hand around her ear. This might help her baby understand that she is using her ears to hear. Mom can point out the sound by saying, "I hear a bird. Listen! Tweet, tweet, tweet, do you hear it too? Where is that bird?” Later, Mom can connect the sound to a real object and challenge her baby to see if she can name a sound that she heard earlier.

"These two blocks look the same. They match!"

<tagline>
Bring your baby’s attention to two objects that are exactly alike.

<takeaway>
Matching things helps your baby recognise how things are similar and how they are different. 

<overview>
Matching involves noticing that two objects look the same. When a baby explores her environment, she naturally notices how things are alike and how they are different. 

<practice>
Talk to Mom about setting up situations for her baby to match two items. There are many ways to make this fun and incorporate it into everyday activities. While doing laundry, she can give her baby three socks—two that match and one that looks very different. Talk to her about matching the socks, by saying something like, "See, this one has a red stripe and this one does too. They match. This one is all yellow; it doesn’t match.”

Using a memory game or any type of game with different cards, suggest that Mom place a few cards face up and ask her baby to find the ones that match; start small, laying only two or three pairs out for her to search. Increase the challenge as she succeeds. Focus on saying the words "same” and "different.”

"You put all your dolls in the crib, all of your teddies are still on your bed!"

<tagline>
Help your baby to recognise how groups can be formed.

<takeaway>
Sorting helps your baby notice similarities among items. 

<overview>
Sorting involves grouping similar objects together. A baby might begin to sort objects based on what she likes or what she is familiar with. She will begin to sort them by characteristics, such as colour, size, shape, texture and sound. Sorting items deepens a baby’s understanding of relationships, patterns and classification.

<practice>
Ask Mom to watch when her baby begins to group objects on her own. She might separate peas from carrots on her dinner plate or put stuffed animals on one side of the bed and dolls on the other side. This lets Mom know she is already recognizing similarities and differences. Mom can give her many chances to practise grouping in daily routines. When cleaning up toys, she can help her baby sort by talking about where each toy belongs, such as, "Blocks belong in this tub and doll clothes go in this basket.” Or when Mom is putting dishes away, she can encourage her baby to put cutlery in the correct spot.

When Mom is reading a book with her baby, suggest that she ask her baby to point at all the dogs, or all the red balloons, or any other category in the book. Mom can try putting out a red plate and a blue plate, with a variety of red and blue objects nearby and ask her baby where the objects should go.

What's Inside

<quotation>
"You are touching a rock; it is hard."

<tagline>
Ask your baby to reach into a box that has different objects inside and to select the object with a specific texture.

<takeaway>
Your baby can connect the names of different textures to a feeling in her hands and on her body. 

<overview>
A baby explores her environment by touching. Putting words to a texture she feels gives her a deeper understanding of her sensory world. She might begin to group textures and form preferences or opinions based on the characteristics of different items.

<practice>
To help her baby learn about textures, suggest that Mom choose two or three objects that feel very different and have a simple word to describe them. A cotton ball is soft, a rock is hard and a pinecone is crunchy. These can be offered to her baby one at a time, as Mom explains "This is a pinecone, it feels so crunchy!” Remind Mom that her baby will need time to explore each item as she describes what her baby is doing and feeling.

Once she is familiar with the items, Mom can turn the exploration into a game. After Mom labels the items a few times, she can place the items into a bag or a box so that her baby cannot see them. Mom can then ask, "Can you find something that is crunchy?” and have her reach into the bag. Whichever item she pulls out, encourage Mom to stay positive and encouraging, saying, "You found the rock, the rock is hard. Do you remember which one was crunchy?”

Eventually Mom can use those descriptive words in other contexts, such as, "You’re walking through all those brown leaves; how do they feel? That’s right, they are crunchy. Crunch, crunch, crunch!”

<quotation>
"Hold your hands out in front of you. 1, 2, 3, catch!"

<tagline>
Play a simple game of catch with a ball that is easy for your baby to hold.

<takeaway>
A simple game of catch is a way to practise taking turns and to develop muscle control. 

<overview>
Throwing and catching only works when you have a partner. A baby needs to trust that when she throws the ball, the other person will throw it back. She needs to give the ball away in order to get it back, which makes the game successful and fun.

<practice>
Suggest that Mom start with a large soft ball and stand a short distance away from her baby. She can show her baby the ball and let her know what she will do, "Can you see the ball? I’m going to throw it to you. You got it!” Mom should expect it to take some time and practise before her baby understands that it will come back. She can gently encourage her baby to throw it back. Mom can repeat this activity, enthusiastically cheering her baby on when she is successful.

If this is too difficult and her baby is discouraged, Mom can make it easier by sitting on the floor and rolling the ball back and forth. When her baby masters rolling, she can work up to bouncing the ball back. As she becomes more capable, Mom can stand further back, using smaller balls. This is a skill that will develop gradually over several years, so it’s important to go slowly and have fun.

Is your baby able to throw and catch a ball? What other games does she play that help develop her muscle control?

More and Less

<title>

<quotation>
"You have more strawberries than me!"

<tagline>
Compare amounts by labelling them as more or less.

<takeaway>
Talking about how many items there are increases your baby’s awareness of math concepts.
 
<overview>
Some children are gifted when it comes to using and understanding numbers and others need support. These differences are not noticeable until later in childhood. Talking about math concepts early in life encourages a baby to think about numbers. It also helps her learn to appreciate math concepts throughout her life.

<practice>
Suggest that Mom focus on using the words "more” and "less” throughout the day. This will build on activities like saying numbers out loud and counting, which Mom and her baby have been practising. 

Mom can get her baby involved in daily tasks. Mom might ask, "I only have one baby wipe, can you pass me one more baby wipe? Thank you, now I have two baby wipes!” This will help her understand that two is more than one. While cleaning up, Mom can say, "If we both pick up the toys, there will be less work to do.”

Any activity with two or more items presents an opportunity for this activity. Suggest that Mom build two tall towers of blocks and then count the blocks with her baby, asking, "Which tower has less blocks?” Or Mom can hold two clear cups of water while playing in the bath and ask, "Can you show me which one has less water?”

It takes time for a baby to learn new words, so responding positively when she makes a mistake is preferable, such as, "My tower just has three blocks but your tower has five! My tower has less blocks.” By using "more” and "less” often and in many different situations, her baby will understand what it means in a few short weeks.

<reflection>
When you first start using these new words, how does your baby respond?
