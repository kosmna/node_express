“That’s a really good question. Let’s go find the answer together.”

<tagline>
Help a child find answers to her questions. 

<takeaway>
Supporting children in the exploration of topics they are interested in helps them develop problem-solving skills and a love for learning.  

<overview>
As children grow, they develop more of their own interests. As they gain a more complex view of the world, they begin to have more complex questions. When parents/caregivers model how to find answers to their questions, children learn to use the resources at their disposal to find answers. When their curiosity is supported, children develop a love of learning. 

<practice>
<in the home>
You can encourage parents/caregivers to pay attention to what their child shows an interest in. She may ask questions about or want to talk about a specific topic a lot. If, for instance, their child loves construction vehicles, they can ask, “What do you know about these big trucks? Where do you think we can find more information about them?” Parents/caregivers may want to go to a construction site to watch the vehicles at work. Encourage them to use books to look up the names and uses of vehicles with their child. If they don’t have the relevant books at home, you can suggest they visit a library. 

<in the centre>
Pay attention to what the children are interested in and think about how you can integrate their interests into your curriculum and daily activities. They might ask questions or want to talk about a specific topic a lot. You can use a flip chart or whiteboard to create a web to visually present what the children already know about a topic, what they would like to learn and where they think they might find the information. If the children are interested in firefighters, you can write “firefighters” in the middle and ask questions such as, “What do you know about firefighters? Do you have any questions about firefighting? Where do you think we can find more information?” Create a branch for each type of question, adding the children’s answers to the relevant section. You can use the web as a guide for creating activities and use it to brainstorm with the children where they can find answers to their questions.  
 
If you ask, “Where can we find more information about firefighters?” and they respond, “From books!” or “At the fire station,” you can write down their responses and incorporate them into the daily lessons. You can add the web to documentation on the wall, highlighting how the children asked questions, brainstormed how and where to look for information, and how, as a group, you found that information. This could include reading books about firefighting, visiting or writing to a local fire station or inviting a firefighter to the centre.  

<reflection>
How can you tell what topics a child is interested in? 
How do you get information about subjects you are interested in? 
What do you say when a child asks a question that you don’t know the answer to? 
How do you make looking up information with a child fun?  
How will your enthusiasm about a child’s interests affect her attitude toward learning in the future?

<tagline>
Provide items for play that have many ways for children to engage with them. 

<takeaway>
Loose parts and open-ended materials and encourage imaginative play. 

<overview>
Parents/caregivers can support a child’s creativity by providing adaptable toys that encourage many types of imaginative play. It is best to avoid toys that have lights, make a lot of noise or have limited purpose. Such toys “do the work” for children because they predetermine how children will engage with them.  
 
Loose parts and open-ended materials are materials that do not have a set purpose and that inspire children to use their imagination, allowing them to actively engage with them. With loose parts, children use symbolic representation, assign roles and create dialogue with the items they play with. Children benefit most when they play with these open-ended materials, such as blocks, dolls, sticks and rocks, because they must think of new and creative ways to engage with them. 

<practice>
<in the home>
You can talk to parents/caregivers about the open-ended items they may have at home such as boxes and empty plastic containers. Encourage them to show their child how a kitchen pot can double as a crib for his baby doll. They can provide items from around the house or from outside like newspaper, paper towel tubes, pots, containers, cups, sticks, leaves or rocks to give their child many options for play. They may try holding a banana to their ear and saying, “Hello!” encouraging the child to choose an item to “answer the phone.” There is an abundance of open-ended play materials outdoors. A stick can be a magic wand, a sword or a fishing rod. Encourage parents/caregivers to ask their child to think about items in new ways by offering suggestions, saying things like, “Wow, that’s a very long stick you found. And it has a perfect handle, just like a fishing rod. What can we add to our stick to turn it into a fishing rod?” When an item can be used in a variety of ways, children get the most value out of their play experiences. 

<in the centre>
You can try to stock the centre with loose parts and open-ended toys and materials to encourage children’s creative play. Loose parts can be used in a variety of ways, and how children use the materials will change as they grow. Open-ended toys are also free of commercial branding, allowing children to impart their own creativity onto them. These materials will help inspire children’s critical thinking by encouraging them to question what they can do with the toys.  
 
Open-ended toys and materials can include plain wooden blocks, easels and art supplies for free creative time, play fabrics, wooden dolls, cardboard boxes, paper towel tubes and outdoor materials like sticks, leaves and rocks. If you are playing outside or going on a walk, you can work together as a group to find natural loose parts. Look for interesting leaves, rocks, sticks and pinecones to take back to the centre. These can be incorporated into activities later in the day. For instance, you can place sticks and leaves in the art area, allowing children to use them to paint a picture. Rocks and pinecones could be incorporated into a sensory bin with other natural materials like sand, water and shells. 

<reflection>
What were your favourite materials to play with as a child? 
Where did you get them from? 
What are the child’s favourite things to play with? 
What does he play that with that holds his attention the longest?

“What will your baby eat for dinner today?”

<tagline>
Support your child in pretend play. 

<takeaway>
Developing storylines in pretend play supports cooperation, empathy and literacy skills. 

<overview>
Dramatic play builds on the imitation play that infants and toddlers engage in and has many benefits. It allows children to work through things they are experiencing in their lives. For instance, if a child is adjusting to the arrival of a sibling and her changing role in the family, she might represent this in play.  
 
Pretend play builds children’s literacy skills, social skills and cooperation. As children create play situations, they tend to mimic a storyline with a beginning, middle and end and often even include a conflict to overcome. In pretend play, children have to work together to follow determined rules and imagine the roles and experiences of their characters. 

<practice>
<in the home>
Encourage parents/caregivers to provide props and costumes to inspire their child to be creative in her dramatic play. Even household items—like hats, scarves, gardening tools, pots, pans and dishes—are great for play. These props can encourage their child to think through real-life processes. With a notepad and paper, for instance, she might act out being a server at a restaurant. By mimicking how she has seen these items being used, she will gain insight into how they might be useful in her own life.  
 
Let parents/caregivers know that they can enhance their child’s dramatic play by asking questions that encourage her to think about how things happen and why. For example, “Charlie, we need to go to the store. What do we need? Can you get your baby ready to go out?” Encourage parents/caregivers to think about a storyline their child can act out. They can set up a line of chairs and pretend they’re the seats of a car. They might jump in the passenger seat and say, “Where are we going today?” 

<in the centre>
You can enhance children’s dramatic play by setting up a dramatic play centre and changing the theme regularly to include things the children are interested in, or to complement other activities going on in the centre. Dress-up clothes, regular clothes, aprons, play dishes, notepads, pencils, cardboard boxes, play food, bags, bandages, cups and stuffed animals are all items children might play with in a dramatic play centre. You can have children help create dramatic play materials themselves; if they like pretending to sell cookies at a stand, you can invite them to make their own paper cookies to sell or help to write a menu for their cookie shop. With a dress shirt, a stuffed animal and some bandages, a child can act out being a doctor or a veterinarian. By mimicking how she has seen these items being used, a child will gain insight into how they might be useful in her own life.  
 
If you have recently taken a field trip to the post office or you invited the children to write their own letters to send, you might want to set up a post office for dramatic play. For this, you can prepare a table with paper, envelopes, pencils, crayons, stamps and a mailbox. The children will pretend to send letters and work at the post office. 

<reflection>
What is an example of a real-life situation that the child acts out in her pretend play? 
Who does she play with? 
What other items around the house or centre can the child use for pretend play?

“You’re galloping like a horse.”

<tagline>
Label a child’s movements as he moves in new and interesting ways. 

<takeaway>
Children build coordination as they learn to move in new ways. Describing children’s actions as they move builds their vocabulary. 

<overview>
Engaging his senses (hearing and sight) and understanding his own body’s relationship to his surroundings enable a child to learn more efficiently. When children’s actions are associated with animals, they are given a reference to consider in their imaginative play. This encourages them to consider the similarities and differences between the behaviours of others and their own. In acting out animal actions, children coordinate multiple senses, moving their bodies as they absorb new words. 

<practice>
<in the home>
You can explain to parents/caregivers that they can play this game at the park, in the backyard, while walking to school, at the grocery store or even while trying to get their child out of the house. The game is all about encouraging the child to move his body and describing his movements using words he might not be familiar with. For example, “You are stomping your feet like an elephant.”  
 
Encourage parents/caregivers to join in with their child in play, laughing and showing enthusiasm. Modelling the animal action might be helpful for their child; seeing the action will help him connect it with a word. “Let’s tiptoe like a mouse up the stairs,” “slither like a snake,” “hop like a bunny,” or “crawl like a dog.”  

<in the centre>
You can play Simon Says to encourage children to follow movement-based instructions, such as “Simon says, hop like a bunny” or “slither like a snake.” Children who do not yet recognise these words will benefit from an adult modelling this new movement; they will also benefit from seeing how their friends move. Once children are familiar with some of these words, you can play Who Am I” where you and the children take turns pretending to move like an animal, and everyone else has to try to guess what animal you are. You might also want to insert movements throughout your daily routine with the group. For instance, when asking the children to line up, you can also ask them to “gallop like a horse to the line to go inside.” 

<reflection>
How do you know when a child needs to move his body? 
Where is there enough space for the child to move around? 
How can you turn this activity into one-on-one quality time? 
How can you incorporate movement into a group activity?

“Look how fast you are running.”

<tagline>
Find fun ways for a child to become involved with other children. 

<takeaway>
Racing with friends builds children’s social skills and physical development. 

<overview>
Children learn many things when they take part in a race or simple game with their friends. Active games encourage children to use their energy and creativity in productive ways. They learn patience as they wait for “Go!” They learn to handle competition. They practise being a gracious winner or loser. As children grow older, they have an increasing desire to play with other children their own age. Adults in the child’s life can structure games for children while they are learning, so eventually they can pick them up and play with other children on their own. 

<practice>
<in the home>
Encourage parents/caregivers to help their child establish the rules of a race. Once the rules are set, they can model being a good play partner. Parents/caregivers can let their child practise both winning and losing a race and act the same in both instances by saying, “Good race, let’s play again!” then give her a hug or high five. They can encourage their child to ask her siblings or cousins to race with her. Let parents/caregivers know that racing around the house or from her bedroom to the kitchen are other ways to play this game. 
 
When their child is ready for more of a challenge, parents/caregivers can set up a relay or an obstacle course for her to try with her friends. They can set up some chairs for the children to crawl under, a box for them to jump over or a ball for them to throw into a bucket before they race to the finish line. Racing can also be a way to encourage children to clean up quickly. This may present more of a challenge because it requires the child to cooperate as she competes.  

<in the centre>
When choosing a game to play with children, take time to make sure they understand the rules. Once they do, children can practise being good play partners or teammates, demonstrating the importance of having fun and highlighting the fact that no one is better or worse for winning or losing. Playing games like Simon Says, Red Light, Green Light, Duck, Duck, Goose or Musical Chairs supports children’s learning while allowing them to burn off energy and boost their social skills.

“That ball of snow could be the head of your snowman.”

<tagline>
Help a child put pieces together to complete a whole object. 

<takeaway>
Thinking about the parts that make up an object teaches a child about shapes, their respective uses and how they fit together. 

<overview>
Learning the parts of an object helps children understand how they work together for a strategic purpose. This helps children think about the respective shapes that make up an object and encourages them to think of alternative uses for them.  

<practice>
<in the home>
Suggest to parents/caregivers that they prepare supplies such as paint, blocks, playdough or sand. Then they can ask their child to choose an object to draw or create together with them. This could be a body, a truck, a house or a flower. Next, encourage them to talk to him about how to break down the object into shapes. You can recommend that parents/caregivers point out the pieces that make up the larger object while colouring, saying, “When I think of a truck, I think about how the different parts look like shapes. I can use a square for the cab and a rectangle for the box. Can you think about what we can use for the wheels?” Encourage parents/caregivers to think about objects that can be pieced together when playing with sticks and rocks outside. They can model this for their child until he starts to build his own ideas, by saying, “When I place these rocks in a circle, they look a little like the petals of a flower. Is there something around here we could use for the stem?” 

<in the centre>
You can talk with children about parts and wholes. What is a whole and what is a part of a whole? Ask them if they can think of any examples of something that is whole and something that is part of a whole. Document their answers, and include simple drawings to illustrate what they say. You can talk about faces and what different parts make up a face.  
 
You can also cut out shapes with construction paper and invite children to use them to make a whole, using the shapes to make a rocket ship, a fish or a face, for example. You can have a sample you created for the children to reference, or let them create their own. When you’re playing outside, encourage the children to think about how objects in the environment can be pieced together to create a whole. If the children are interested in building a fort, talk to them about what they might use for the various parts: “That tarp makes a really good roof! What could you use to make the walls? Let’s put the pieces of the fort together!” 

<reflection>

“What would happen if I put your boot on before your sock?”

<tagline>
Helping prepare a child for what is going to happen helps her understand things she has done in the past. 

<takeaway>
When children think through hypothetical situations, they learn why things are the way they are.  

<overview>
Children often ask “Why?” because they are building their understanding of why the world works the way it does. They ask questions to make sense of their day-to-day lives. Asking hypothetical questions and thinking about hypothetical situations helps children process what they already know.  

<practice>
<in the home>
Encourage parents/caregivers to playfully help their child think about hypothetical situations. They can do this by asking, “What would happen if we put your shoes on the wrong feet?” or “What would you say if you saw someone hit your friend?” The questions can also be imaginative, such as, “What would happen if a unicorn walked in here right now?” Remind them to give their child time to process the question and answer by herself. She may giggle at some of the questions or just shrug. Asking the same question a few days later, they can see how she has processed it or if her answer has changed at all. 

<in the centre>
Asking children hypothetical questions helps them to make sense of their world, process what they already know and strengthen their critical thinking skills. These questions may be about practical situations, such as “What would happen if we didn’t wear a coat outside?” or “What would you do if your socks were wet?” Practical questions help children understand things that happen in daily life. The questions may also be silly or fantastical to encourage children’s creativity, such as “What would you do if you were turned into a dinosaur?”  
 
You can use visuals to help children answer these questions. If you ask, for example, “What would you do if you spill some paint?” you can include a card that shows a child cleaning up a spill. If you ask a fantastical question, such as, “if you turned into a bug right now, what kind of bug would you be?” you can set out modelling clay so the children can answer the question by creating a clay version of the kind of bug they would be.

How can you tell when a child feels confident in her answer to a question? 
How do you encourage children to think creatively? 
How can asking hypothetical questions be useful when teaching children?

“What kind of food should we have at the party?”

<tagline>
Help a child brainstorm a list of items he needs to plan an event. 

<takeaway>
Planning an event with children teaches them the importance of preparation and that their decision-making is valuable.  

<overview>
Making lists and planning an event with children teaches them the importance of preparation and to anticipate what is needed for an event. When children’s preferences are considered in event planning, they learn that their perspectives are important and their contributions are valuable. 

<practice>
<in the home>
Encourage parents/caregivers to plan an upcoming or imaginary event with their child. They can say, “Hey, maybe we can plan a pizza party together! Remember when we went to Maya’s pizza party? What kind of things did we do?” or “Maybe we can plan a tea party for your dolls! What do we need for a tea party?” Parents/caregivers can talk about the supplies they need for the event. They can validate their child’s suggestions by writing them on a list and then taking them to the store to shop for them. They can then cross items off the list as they are put in the cart.  
 
You can explain that lists can also be created for events like sleeping over at Grandma’s house. Parents/caregivers can ask their child what he will need for his trip, write down his ideas and cross them off as they are packed in his bag. He may need some help. They can prompt him by asking, “What will you need to get ready for bed? That’s right! Go grab your toothbrush!” 

<in the centre>
You can work together with the children to plan an event. For instance, you could set up the dramatic play area in a birthday party theme. You can ask the children about birthday parties they’ve gone to. What activities were there? Ask the children what materials and supplies you need for a birthday party, writing their answers on a list. You can use the list to guide you when planning activities. If the children say a party needs a birthday hat, set out materials for them to make and decorate birthday hats. If they say a party needs presents, provide wrapped paper, newspaper, markers and cardboard boxes for them to wrap their own presents. If they say a party needs cake, provide a cake made from shaving cream for the children to decorate using paint and pipettes, or provide blocks so they can build a block cake.  
 
Another activity to plan together could be an outdoor picnic. Choose a nice day when you can eat lunch or snack outside. You can sit with the children and talk about picnics, asking if anyone has ever been on a one before. Ask, “What supplies do we need for a picnic?” and make a list of their answers. Work together to find everything you need for the picnic, crossing items off the list as you find them. Give each child something to be responsible for finding and bringing outside.  

<reflection>
How does a child feel when he shares his ideas? How can you make sure he feels confident in his contributions?

“When we put salt on the ice, what do you think is going to happen?”

<tagline>
Have the child freeze water to make ice and experiment to discover what will make it melt. 

<takeaway>
Doing experiments with children can teach them about the properties of matter and about cause and effect.  

<overview>
Exploring materials like water, grass, leaves, rocks and sand brings out the natural scientist in a child. Using natural materials is great for teaching children the properties of matter. When children experiment with water, they learn about the properties of liquids. They also learn how to hypothesize outcomes.  

<practice>
<in the home>
You can talk to parents/caregivers about planning an easy educational activity using freezing water. Suggest that they help their child fill a container with water—an ice cube tray, the bottom half of a milk carton or a margarine container—and then put the container in the freezer or outside during the winter. They can add food colouring or put a small plastic toy inside the container to keep the activity interesting. Next, suggest that parents/ caregivers ask questions such as, “What do you think will have happened to this water when we check on it tomorrow morning?” The next day, they can help their child think about the water’s transformation, asking, “What happened to the water?” “How did it turn to ice?” “How can we get your toy out?” “What should we do with it next?” 
 
Parents/caregivers can take the ice out of the container and place it on a baking sheet, in the bathtub or in a container so their child can experiment with it. By offering their child items like spoons, cups of warm water, salt or even paint, they can encourage her to play with the ice in whatever way she wants. 

<in the centre>
There are many educational activities you can do using water and ice. In winter, you can bring some snow inside in a container. Try to help the children to build a small snowman, and talk about what they think will happen to it if it stays inside. Ask “Will it stay as a snowman?” “Will it shrink?” “Will it melt away?” Keep the snowman in the centre and, as a group, observe it and document any changes. You can ask them questions such as, “What happened to the snowman?” and “How did he turn to water?” 
 
If you are learning about dinosaurs, you can talk with the children about how dinosaurs are born from eggs. You can create dinosaur eggs by placing small plastic dinosaurs into balloons and then filling the balloons with water. You can add food colouring to make the eggs more interesting. Freeze the eggs overnight and remove the balloons before setting them in a deep container. Provide warm water, a spray bottle, pipettes, spoons and salt, and help the children hatch some of the eggs. 
 
You can observe naturally occurring changes outdoors anytime. Visit an outdoor space regularly. Throughout the seasons, talk about and document how the trees, water, rocks, plants change as the seasons do. 

<reflection>
How do you see children exploring the elements? 
Where in her environment could a child witness natural changes? 
What are some things you could say to a child to spark her interest during this activity?

Asking children “how many” of something they have or “how many” of something they need in a variety of contexts helps them understand the association between numbers and objects. If they learn the usefulness of counting when they are young, they will recognise the importance of developing numeracy skills as they grow older. 

<practice>
<in the home>
You can talk to parents/caregivers about encouraging their child to count on his own and assisting him only if he needs help. As their child says the numbers out loud, they can point to the items he is counting or group them together. This will help him connect a visual to numbers and understand which numbers are worth more or less than others. You can suggest that parents/caregivers ask questions such ask, “How many steps to get to your bed?” or “How many blackberries would you like?” or “How many blocks did you use to make that tower?” or “How many will I need to make mine the same height?” 
 
As their child gets better at counting, propose that parents/caregivers ask him, “How many plates will we need at the table?” Encourage parents/caregivers to be patient if he takes time to answer, then respond encouragingly to any answer he gives. They can practise more by taking a stack of plates and counting them one by one, then saying, “Okay, let’s try four plates at the table. Does that look like enough?” When playing with toys, they can encourage their child to count in different ways. They can say, “Let’s try counting the blocks together” and group the blocks as he counts them.  

<in the centre>
You can encourage children to count on their own and help them if they need it. You can ask about items around the centre: “How many chairs are around the table?” Or ask about things outside: “How many trees can you see?”  
 
You can also create activities that encourage children to count. You might cut out fish from construction paper, using a paperclip as the mouth, and place them in a container. Then you can take a dowel or stick and tie a string to one end. On the other end of the string, you can tie or hot glue a magnet. Instruct the children to “go fishing” and count every fish they catch. Another activity could be providing the children with playdough tools such as hammers and rollers, asking them to help you roll the playdough into small balls, and placing the balls in a bowl. Together, you could then roll a large die, look at the number on it and invite children to take that many balls from the bowl, flattening each ball as you count it. 

<reflection>
What kinds of things are useful for children to count? 
How can counting be useful for a child during his day? 
If a child needs help, how can you support him without giving him the answer?

“Do you remember what toy I took away?”

<tagline>
Play a short game with a child to have her recall information. 

<takeaway>
Playing games can help the child develop short-term memory. 

<overview>
Children learn best through play. By playing memory games with children, parents/caregivers can challenge them to remember increasing amounts of information.  

<practice>
<in the home>
Encourage parents/caregivers to start by collecting three small items or toys, such as a car, a teddy bear and a cup. Sitting across from their child, they can show her the items, then point to each one and name it. They can ask their child to remember the items as she closes her eyes. Once her eyes are closed, they can put one of the items behind their back. Then, they can ask their child, “Which toy is missing?” Remind parents/caregivers to be patient as she takes her time to consider the answer. They can help her remember which object is missing by listing all the objects originally in place or by describing the hidden item; for example, “The one that is missing is brown and fuzzy.” As her memory improves, they can increase the number of items, including more similar items, such as different-coloured cars. Next, they can encourage their child to lead the game, while they take a turn themselves thinking about what item is missing.  

<in the centre>
There are many activities and games you can play in the centre to support children’s developing memory. You can use cards to create a simple match game, where children turn over cards looking for a matching card. You can also include the children by drawing a picture as a group. To do this, draw a detailed picture and place it where the children can’t see it—perhaps a house with many details or an ocean with lots of fish and sea creatures. Then you can split the children into small groups and give them paper and some pencils. One person from each group will go and look at your picture and try to draw what they remember. Then the next person in the group will go look and try to draw what they remember and so on. They can go look at your picture as many times as they want, with the goal being to copy your picture from what they remember. 
 
Another memory activity, Bug in a Rug, uses a parachute or sheet. Invite the children to all sit around it and close their eyes. Tell them you will walk around and tap one of them on the shoulder, and that child should open her eyes and hide under the parachute. Then tell all the children to open their eyes and guess who is hiding under the sheet. This game engages their memory of who they are sitting with and where, and asks them to notice which of their friends is missing.  

<reflection>
What kinds of items would make this game interesting for a child?

“I’m going to use this square block. Can you find one that looks the same?”

<tagline>
Practise finding items that look the same and those that look different. 

<takeaway>
Children practise early math skills when they think about the similarities and differences between items. 

<overview>
Children naturally begin sorting and categorizing as they develop their views of the world. They start thinking about things they like and things they don’t like, people they know and people they don’t know, something that scared them once and things that remind them of that experience. The words “same” and “different” help children sort through their thinking. Sorting is an early numeracy skill and is the basis for problem solving. 

<practice>
<in the home>
For this game, you can let parents/caregivers know they will need a group of items that are similar but with clear differences in shape, colour, size and so on, such as blocks, toy cars or a deck of cards. Depending on how new their child is to this game, they might want to have only a few items out at a time. Five is a good number to start. Holding up one item, they can say, “Can you find a block that is the same as mine?” They can mention the colour or shape of the item. Repeating the words “same” and “different” many times, they can say, “The item you chose is exactly the same as mine” or “That car is a little bit different. Mine is blue. Can you find a blue car?” 

<in the centre>
Activities you can do you in the centre include putting out objects that are noticeably different, like cars, play food and crayons, and asking children to find two objects that are the same. For young children, use pictures as labels around the centre, showing them visually that the wooden blocks go in one bin and the Lego goes in another. You can set out different-size pom-poms and a muffin tin, placing one pom-pom of each size into the muffin tin to demonstrate where each size should go. Then ask the children to find which pom-poms are the same and which are different, and sort them into the muffin tin.  

<reflection>
When is thinking about “same” and “different” useful in your day? 
In what real-life situations can you play this game with a child? 
What toys does the child have a lot of that you can sort together?

“Take your turn.”

<tagline>
Play a simple board game with a child. 

<takeaway>
Simple board games help children practise following rules and taking turns. 

<overview>
Playing a board game is an advanced stage of play. Children are ready to begin playing with board games when they are interested in playing with friends and can pay attention to a task for an extended amount of time. Board games teach children social skills and math skills, such as counting, one-to-one correspondence and simple addition. For young children, it is best to choose games with only a few rules so they do not get overwhelmed. 

<practice>
<in the home>
Board games can be very simple. You can explain to parents/caregivers that they can choose a store-bought board game, like Candy Land, or something homemade. You can explain that the point of playing a board game is to take turns moving a pawn from start to finish. The person who makes it to the finish line first wins. They can teach their child about alternating turns, rolling the dice and moving a pawn accordingly. You can suggest that parents/caregivers choose a board game that does not have too many rules. 
 
Explain to parents/caregivers that rolling dice or drawing cards can be a great way to teach a child numbers. When she is learning to identify numbers, it is helpful for her to see both the numeral (such as 4) and the amount drawn out for her to count (••••). This helps her succeed no matter how much experience she has with numbers and counting. Parents/caregivers can count out loud with her during play. Who wins and who loses doesn’t matter. Remind parents that it is okay if their child becomes upset if she loses; she will learn from the experience.  

<in the centre>
Games with numbers can be a great way to teach numbers and counting. In Bunny Bedtime, for example, children get to roll the dice and move Bunny along the path. Ask them questions using the pictures on the cards to help Bunny make choices to get ready for bed. Hoot, Owl, Hoot is similar to Candy Land. Children use coloured cards to move along the game board to get the owls back to their nest. You can play with children and help them by counting out loud and moving the cards along the board. 
 
Encourage children to play together. Often children benefit from being engaged with a more knowledgeable peer. It may be helpful for a younger child just learning about games with rules to play with another child who has slightly more experience.  

<reflection>
Do you remember playing board games with your family or friends as a child? Which ones do you remember? 
How do you know when a child is ready for this type of play? 
If she gets upset or frustrated with the outcome of the game, what can you do or say to let her know it’s okay?

“Mom’s socks are the biggest, yours are in the middle and your little sister’s socks are the smallest.”

<tagline>
Give a child a series of items that can be sorted by size. 

<takeaway>
Learning to sequence items is important for numeracy development.  

<overview>
The ability to sort items according to size is foundational to numeracy. It requires children to compare items and put them in a sequence that accounts for their differences. Parents/caregivers can help children learn to sequence using everyday items.  

<practice>
<in the home>
You can ask parents/caregivers to give their child some items that can be sorted by size, such as measuring cups, cutlery, shoes, blocks, dolls, cars, flowers or sticks. They can ask questions to make him think about the items, such as, “Which of your cars is the smallest?” Then they can say, “Put that one to the side. Now, out of the cars you have left, which one is the smallest? Good! Can you put it beside your other small car?” Working with him, they can sort the items by size one by one. With practice, he might be able to understand more complex requests such as, “Can you put your dolls in a line from biggest to smallest?” When he’s ready, the child will be able to work through the task on his own. 
 
Let parents/caregivers know that this game can be played throughout the day. When he helps parents/caregivers do the dishes, they can ask him to put the cups in a line from biggest to smallest. When he is colouring with crayons, he can be asked to look for the smallest ones and sort them by size. Extending the play that he is already interested in will deepen his understanding of objects and concepts. 

<in the centre>
The centre is full of items that you can ask the children to sort by size. You can ask questions to make children think about the items, such as, “Which of your dolls is the smallest?” Then you can say, “Put that one to the side. Now, out of the dolls you have left, which one is the smallest? Good! Can you put it beside your other doll?” Work together to sort the items by size, then talk about how they just sorted their dolls from smallest to biggest, with the smallest doll on one side and the biggest on the other side.  
 
After talking about sorting objects smallest to biggest or biggest to smallest, discuss how people are often different heights. Start by choosing three or four of the children and ask the rest of the group to help line them up from shortest to tallest or tallest to shortest. The more exposure and fun the children have with sorting by size, the more they will develop their sequencing and numeracy skills.  

<reflection>
What items in the home or centre can you sort by size? 
Are there things of different sizes in nature that you can talk to a child about? 
How can you show your child his own growth or how something grows over time?

“How do you and your mom take care of your new baby?”

<tagline>
Ask questions that get a child thinking deeply about the things she knows. 

<takeaway>
One-on-one conversation time with parents/caregivers helps children feel validated and develop a strong self-concept.  

<overview>
Children have more wisdom than parents/caregivers tend to give them credit for. Their perspectives and opinions, although valuable, are not always honoured. Children feel validated when their thoughts and opinions are acknowledged and they feel listened to. Having genuine, honest and thoughtful conversations with children helps them to develop a strong self-concept and confidence in their self-expression.  

<practice>
<in the home>
You can encourage parents/caregivers to schedule one-on-one time for conversation with their child. This is a good time to ask questions, such as, “What was your favourite part of the day?” or “How did your mom get your little sister to sleep this afternoon?” or “What helps your little sister feel happy?” or “Did you see that flock of geese fly by? What do you know about geese?” or “We went to a community feast a few weeks ago. What did we do there?” or “I like the dog you’re drawing! What kinds of things do you know about dogs?” 
 
You can remind parents/caregivers to pay attention to their child’s interests and ask about things that matter to her. They can ask their child what she knows, thinks or feels about a topic. Sometimes she will respond with really big questions that can be difficult to answer. She might ask about something parents/caregivers don’t know the answer to, like, “Why did the dinosaurs die?” Or she might ask about difficult topics, such as death or gender. Remind parents/caregivers that if they don’t have the answers, they can model honesty and humility and say, “I don’t know, but we can find out together.” 

<in the centre>
You can speak with children one-on-one to ask them questions about things that happen in their lives, such as, “What was your favourite part of your weekend?” or “How did your mom/dad cook dinner last night?” You can also ask questions to the group during circle time; creating a visual web as you talk with children before starting a new activity or unit will help to demonstrate what they already know and what questions they have about the topic. A web also visibly documents what the children have learned as the unit continues. If the topic is birthdays, you can ask the children “What is a birthday?" or “What does your family do for someone’s birthday?” or “You went to a birthday party? What did you do there?”  
 
Asking questions demonstrates that children’s views and opinions matter to you, and helps you to better understand the child and prepare classroom activities that align with their interests. When you don’t know the answer to a child’s question, take steps to find out together as a group.   

<reflection>
What are a child’s gifts?
