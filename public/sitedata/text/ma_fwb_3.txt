“My favourite part of my day was making dinner with you. What was yours?”

<tagline>
Enjoy meals with a child by slowing down and enjoying his company. 

<takeaway>
Spending quality time together as a family helps promote healthy eating and conversation skills. It teaches children that they are valued. 

<overview>
Children benefit from having regular meals with family. Coming together as a family helps children feel valued, allows them to develop a sense of belonging and improves their health, well-being and social skills  

<practice>
<in the home>
You can talk to parents/caregivers about showing their child the importance of family by setting aside time to enjoy dinner together. This might be with just the parents and the child or with aunties, cousins and grandparents. Eating together helps a child build strong familial bonds. The purpose is not to focus on what or how much the child is eating; instead, the focus should be on spending quality time together.  
 
Discuss how small teachable moments occur during mealtimes, including talking about food groups, remembering the day or setting and clearing the table. It’s a good time to model conversation skills by asking questions and listening to each person at the table. To support quality time, it is helpful to minimize distractions and ensure that phones, electronic devices and the TV are turned off during the meal. 

<in the centre>
Whether it is snack time or lunchtime, keep in mind the importance of creating an enjoyable mealtime environment. Serving meals family-style, with children together at a table, encourages them to talk and observe one another. During snack time, children can have the opportunity to develop independence and self-care skills by serving themselves. If you use placemats or utensils, ask the children to help set the table or to put their dishes away. You can encourage children to eat their food, but don’t force them. 
 
You can show enthusiasm for healthy foods and encourage children to do the same. During mealtime, it is important to sit with the children and talk with them as they eat, showing them you’re still available if a child needs support. If you are introducing a new food, read a book together about the food before serving it as a snack. Occasionally, you might involve the children d in helping to prepare a snack, by spreading jam or mixing and pouring batter; this will boost their confidence and can encourage them to try what they’ve made. 

<reflection>
What were your experiences eating together as a family or with others growing up? Did it happen regularly or on special occasions? 
What about these times meant the most to you? 
How can you make mealtimes a positive experience?

Honouring Your Word

FAMILY WELL-BEING | 2

<title>

“I will be there to play with you in 10 minutes.”

<tagline>
With your actions, show your child that no matter what, you will always be there for her. 

<takeaway>
When children trust their parents/caregivers to keep their word and keep them safe, they grow confident in themselves and in their relationships.  

<overview>
Parents/caregivers prove that they are worthy of a child’s trust when they stay true to their commitments. Children need to trust that parents/caregivers will care for them and keep them safe. This helps children develop secure attachments. When children are securely attached in their relationships, they have the confidence and self-esteem to explore their environments and engage in new experiences. The quality of the attachment a child develops with her parents/caregivers in the early years determines the trust and confidence she has in herself and in others as she grows older.  
 
Honouring your word is an important part of building trust with a child. It shows her that her parents/caregivers are accountable to her and responsible for her well-being. 

<practice>
<in the home>
You can tell parents/caregivers that it’s not a good idea to make promises they can’t keep. To feel safe, children need to trust that parents/caregivers will be present and follow through on what they say they will do. Keeping everyday promises is as important as keeping more substantive ones. After all, if she can’t trust her parents/caregivers with the little things, how can she trust them with the big things? 
 
You can explain to parents/caregivers that if they cannot live up to something they promised, it’s a good idea to explain why and apologize sincerely. This will ensure that she continues to feel safe and cared for even as schedules change and unforeseen events arise. 

<in the centre>
Keeping your word to children means being consistent in what you say and do in the centre. If you tell children that you are going to do something, go outside, do a certain activity or play a game with them, you should always strive to make sure you follow through. This helps children to feel secure and to learn the concept of commitment. Young children might not always understand abstract concepts like keeping a promise, but if you model consistent reliability, you can help them to build the foundation for understanding the concept later. To help children understand the importance of keeping their word, you can read books to them that show characters keeping and breaking their promises. You can ask if that has ever happened to them and talk about how important it is to stick to the commitments we make.  

<reflection>
Do you remember a time when someone failed to keep a promise to you? How did it make you feel? How did it affect the trust you had in them? 
Do you remember a time when you failed to keep your word to a child? What happened and how did it affect the child?

Supporting Friendships

FAMILY WELL-BEING | 3

<title>

“Your friend is coming over!”

<tagline>
Support the friendships a child develops with children his age. 

<takeaway>
Strong social skills help children feel confident when they start school. 

<overview>
Children learn social skills through practice and through informal, playful interactions with children of similar age. When children are provided with uninterrupted time and materials to play with together, they learn to cooperate, work through problems together and communicate. Friendships can teach children the social skills they need for a smooth transition into school. 

<practice>
<in the home>
You can encourage parents/caregivers to organize playdates for their child. This is a good way to encourage him to make friends. He might feel shy at first and need some time to warm up to others. They can support him by letting him play with others without parental participation. When children have uninterrupted time with their peers, they learn to organize themselves, communicate their needs and solve problems on their own. When parents/caregivers get too involved in play, children begin to rely on them to direct their play. Explain to parents/caregivers that they can find opportunities for their child to play with his peers by visiting family members, going to preschool drop-in programs or attending community events.  

<in the centre>
Children spend so much time in the centre together with other children that it is important to foster a positive classroom culture. When they spend much of the day around others, they learn and practise social and communication skills. Young children often want to play with friends but sometimes need to learn how to treat them. You can teach appropriate ways to behave as a friend and model specific concepts to support children to build healthy friendships. Provide playtime that is uninterrupted and unstructured to allow children to organize their own play.   
 
If you hear children arguing and no one is in immediate danger, you can give the children the space to work it out on their own or wait for them to ask you for help. This activity can be supported by working on social and communication skills, and talking to them about friendships. You can teach children that friends can be mad at each other and still be friends, or that friends don’t always have to play together. You can model positive social skills by spending time with each of the children, so they see you playing with everyone.  

<reflection>
Does the child talk about his friendships? Who does he talk about? 
How do you support him spending regular time with his friends? Do they have large amounts of uninterrupted time to play? 
How can you support a child’s play without being directly involved? 
Do you have relationships with other parents? Where can you go to meet other parents who have children the same age?

Changing Sleep Schedule

“Close your eyes. Let’s see if you’re ready for a nap.”

<tagline>
Pay attention to your child’s sleep needs. 

<takeaway>
Good sleep promotes positive behaviours and growth.  

<overview>
Children’s sleep needs are constantly evolving. As babies, they sleep on and off throughout the day. Between 12 and 24 months, they generally go down to one nap a day and sleep for a longer period at night. Around 36 to 48 months, they might not need to nap during the day. Children’s behaviours are a good indicator of whether they are getting enough sleep. A tired child may be more emotional than usual or difficult to settle. Children also tend to have a harder time sleeping when they are overtired. Monitoring children’s sleep is important to helping them stay happy and healthy. 

<practice>
<in the home>
You can talk to parents/caregivers about paying attention to their child’s need for sleep. They can take note of what time she falls asleep, what time she wakes up and the times throughout the day when she starts to get sleepy again. It is a good idea for parents/caregivers to build a routine around her sleep so she can unwind beforehand. They might find that if she sleeps too much or too little during the day, she won’t sleep well at night.  
 
For a 36-month-old, a nap that lasts one to two hours is long enough. This is a good age to cut down naps during the day, if need be. A change in schedule can be difficult for everyone, but patience and consistency will help smooth the transition. 

<in the centre>
You can pay attention to the children’s behaviour throughout the day and include information about their nap that day in your conversations with parents/caregivers. You can pay attention to what time a child falls asleep, what time she wakes up and if you notice that she is tired or energetic throughout the day. It is important to keep in contact with parents/caregivers about how their child is sleeping at home, and how she is sleeping at the centre. For older children who may be outgrowing or cutting down on naps, allow them time to rest, even if they don’t sleep. Let them take a quiet activity to their cot, like a book or a stuffed animal that they can play with without disturbing others. You can put together “quiet bins” that include quiet materials like pipe cleaners, pom-poms, cards, stuffed animals and small foam blocks, and allow them to take one of the bins to their cot during quiet time.

“We have 20 minutes to play before dinner is ready. What should we do?”

<tagline>
Spend quality time playing with a child. 

<takeaway>
Spending one-on-one quality time with a child helps him feel loved and cared for. Quality time is also an opportunity to support certain areas of his development.  

<overview>
Children tend to act out when they are looking to feel connected to an adult. Their negative behaviour generally improves when parents/caregivers afford them uninterrupted time and attention. Children won’t always remember special clothes, video games or toys, but they will remember the quality time they spent with a loved one. It makes them feel cared for and worthwhile. Parents/caregivers can use one-on-one time with children to model social skills and introduce new ideas. When children spend time with a more knowledgeable play partner, it helps their social-emotional and intellectual development.  

<practice>
<in the home>
You can talk to parents/caregivers about setting aside quality time to play with their child. Quality time means turning off the TV and screens and focusing on their child. They can take note of what sustains her interest for a period of time, and then they can join in on the activity. Or they can invite her to play something new. They can toss a ball, build with blocks, draw or paint with her. Children also love to play pretend at this stage of development, and parents/caregivers can support imagination by playing with them, perhaps modelling social skills by taking on particular characters.  
 
You may want to talk about the difficulty parents/caregivers may have playing at a child’s level. Recommend that they can start by following their child’s cues and directions and then trying to add to her play. For example, while she is pretending to race cars around a track made of blocks, parents/caregivers can offer her a paper towel tube to drive the cars through. This will introduce ideas she may not have thought of by herself.  

<in the centre>
You can take time throughout the day to engage in quality playtime with the children in the centre. You can play familiar games with children or introduce new activities. Get down on their level, listen to what they say, draw or paint together or play a board game. You can play pretend with children, modelling social skills by playing particular characters. Follow children’s cues when playing and try to add to the play if it makes sense. For example, if you are painting together and a child is using only a brush, you can offer other things to paint with, like sponges, sticks or pipettes. This can help to introduce ideas the child may not have thought of before.

Positive Reinforcement

“That was so kind. Thank you!”

<tagline>
Let a child know when she is demonstrating positive behaviour. 

<takeaway>
Positive reinforcement helps a child know what she should do. 

<overview>
Parents/caregivers tend to overuse the words “no,” don’t” and “stop. When children hear negative comments about their behaviour, they tend to respond defensively or shut down. When this happens, children are no longer willing to listen to or learn from their caregivers. Parents/caregivers should instead positively reinforce the behaviours they desire in their child. Positive attention from parents/caregivers is a child’s greatest motivator.  

<practice>
<in the home>
Spend a little time with parents/caregivers thinking about the kinds of behaviours they are looking for in their child. Do they want her to use manners, treat others with respect or help others when she can? Once the desired behaviours are identified, talk about how to positively reinforce them. One good way to do this is by labelling positive behaviours; for example, “When you hung up your jacket by yourself, it was really helpful.” Parents/caregivers can label how a child’s behaviour affected someone or how it made them feel good: “I’m so proud that you remembered! When you help me out with little things it makes me so happy.” Thanking her for her behaviour is a good way of reinforcing it. In time, parents/caregivers will find that positive reinforcement is far more effective and takes less energy than always correcting negative behaviours. 

<in the centre>
In a centre, it can be much easier to spot negative behaviours than positive ones. Behaviours like yelling, throwing and pushing are louder than positive behaviours like listening, sharing and being a good friend. You can choose to focus on the positive behaviours of the children, choosing from many methods to reinforce the behaviours you want to see. If you notice a student sharing well with her friends, you can verbally praise her behaviour and reward her by letting her be a line leader when going outside. If you notice a student has been using her manners, you can send a note home praising her behaviour to her parents/caregivers.  
 
Positive reinforcement may be verbal praise, an activity-based reward or even something physical, such as giving a high-five or a thumbs-up. You should try to remember to reinforce the positive behaviour of the children who are behaving well, but also the behaviour of those children who are struggling and trying to improve. If these children never receive positive attention from you, they may start to feel bad about themselves so try to always recognise a child’s efforts.  

<reflection>
When has positive reinforcement helped you? How do you feel receiving positive rather than negative reinforcement? 
When do you notice children acting in positive ways? What is your typical way of responding to this behaviour? 
How do you typically respond to a child’s negative behaviour?  
How does the child respond when you give her positive reinforcement?

Risky Play

<tagline>
Understand why a child takes risks and how to support him when he does. 

<takeaway>
Trying new and risky things helps children overcome challenges, face their fears and gain confidence. Taking risks teaches children to deal with adversity and increases their resilience.  

<overview>
When children take risks, they experience a rush of adrenalin and feel-good endorphins. Risk-taking helps children learn to self-regulate in the face of excitement or stress. Although it might feel counterintuitive, parents/caregivers should support rather than discourage risk-taking. Through risk-taking, children learn to respond to scary and adverse situations, developing resilience as they grow.  

<practice>
<in the home>
You can suggest that parents/caregivers watch for things their child tries that makes them nervous. Examples of risky behaviour include experimenting with heights (such as jumping out of a tree), moving at high speeds (such as tobogganing), exploring the elements (such as adding a log to a fire), using sharp tools (such as cutting berries) or rough and tumble play. Encourage parents/caregivers to stop and think about where their child is in his development. What can he do? What can he almost do? What is he not yet ready to try? If he thinks he can jump off the couch, he is probably right. It is often parents’/caregivers’ feelings about a situation that hold children back from confronting their fears or facing a challenge.  
 
Some risky play he may want to try will be too advanced for him. For example, he may want to climb up the slide after seeing his brother do it. Talk to parents/caregivers about letting him try if he wants to and be close by to catch him if he falls, but refraining from helping him if he cannot climb up on his own. The activity might simply be too advanced for him. He will understand this if he tries and learns this for himself.  

<in the centre>
You can encourage and support children to engage in risky play throughout the day. You may be inclined to stop them, because you are nervous about the risk involved.  Instead, you can encourage children to think about their actions without demotivating them by asking, “What is your plan?” or “What is your next step?” or “How are you going to do that?” or ”How can we make sure you stay safe while you climb that tree?’” 
 
You can use indirect guidance to set up the environment to prevent some riskier play while not disallowing it altogether. If there are trees outside, you can assess how high you think the children are ready to climb and tie a ribbon at that height. Then you can explain to children that they can climb the trees, but not higher than the ribbon. You can also work with children to notice the potential risks by drawing their attention to the factors that can increase risk: “Do you see how those leaves are wet from the rain? If something is wet it can become slippery, and you might slip if you run on them.” This allows children to begin to make informed decisions, supporting their growing independence and teaching them to assess potentially risky situations on their own. 

<reflection>
How do you feel when a child tries new skills that are a little risky? 
What kinds of play did you participate in as a child that your parents/caregivers found dangerous? How did it make you feel? 
When a child is engaged in risky play, what is the worst-case scenario? What kinds of plans or adjustments can you make to avoid that?

Determine the next steps in supporting a child’s education. 

<takeaway>
Being involved in formal education settings prepares children for school. 

<overview>
Early learning programs can instill a love of learning. Such programs can support a child’s gifts and interests, challenge her as she progresses through developmental milestones and prepare her for school. But a child might still need some additional professional support before she is ready for school. She might need more opportunities to learn with and from friends. Parents/caregivers might also need support to determine what kinds of programming a child might benefit from to ensure that she excels once she starts school. 

<practice>
<in the home>
If parents/caregivers want to get back to work, you can help them find childcare. Help them sign up for Head Start, look for regular drop-in play opportunities and find programming to address their child’s specific needs. Once their child begins a program, you can support parents/caregivers to check in with their child’s educator often to map her progress and assess how she can be helped at home as she transitions toward school readiness. 

<in the centre>
You can prepare a new child’s cubby in advance of her first day. Add the child to centre documentation, like a birthday board or a picture board to help her see herself when she arrives. Invite the other children to create a welcome sign for her on the door. Remember that this new situation might be scary or intimidating for the child and the family. You can show the child around the centre and introduce her to the group. Ask the other children if anyone would like to be the new child’s buddy while she gets used to the centre. Plan both group activities to include the child and time for independent play to allow her some time if she needs it. You can keep in close contact with the child’s family throughout her first days to let them know how she is doing. 

<reflection>
What was your education like in your early years of life? Who taught you? How is this different from what children have available to them now? 
What do you hope for children in their preschool years? 
How can they be supported to be ready for school?
