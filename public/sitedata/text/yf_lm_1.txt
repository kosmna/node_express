<episode>Talk Face to Face<index>Language Matters | 1<title>"I see you and you are seeing me."<tagline>Hold your child close to your face and say a few words.<takeaway> Your child will start to connect the sound of your voice with your face. <overview> A mom’s voice remains a constant from inside the womb to the outside world and is familiar to a child before and after birth. A parent/caregiver who uses a warm, supportive voice while talking face to face with her child promotes attachment and language development.Moms and other caregivers can start talking to their children early to help them learn patterns of speech. A newborn baby will turn her eyes toward the source of a sound, especially a sound she feels connected to.<practice> Ask Mom to try talking face to face with her child. Explain that this builds on all of the bonding she did with her baby when she was speaking to her pregnant belly. Children learn that the voice they already know is connected to the face they often see. It’s good for Mom to know that by looking into her newborn’s eyes and talking to her often, she is helping her baby learn that sounds and speech are important. A child starts to connect these actions to the positive feelings that come with hearing Mom’s comforting voice. She connects the sounds she hears to people and things. <reflection> How close do you need to be before baby catches your eye contact?What tone of voice do you use when you talk to her? In what situations do you speak to your child? How do you feel when you are spending quality time with your child?<keywords>Language; newborn; crying; communication; listening; preference; talking; mother's voice; cognitive; development; Language; mother-child; communication; eye-contact; nurturing; breastfeeding; bond; love; expression; cues; serve & return; responsive; attentive; Language; serve & return; receptive; expressive; communication; cues; relationship; responsive; attentive; attachment; bonding
<episode>Where Am I?<index>Language Matters | 2<title>"Aliah, where am I?"<tagline>Whisper in your child’s ear or stand behind her, out of sight, and say her name. Wait for her to turn toward you.<takeaway> Your child can hear sounds and turn toward them. <overview> Newborns have a well-developed sense of hearing and start developing early language skills immediately after birth. This works with a skill they already have: the ability to move their head and neck. Now they can turn their head to see their mom when they hear her voice. <practice> Explain to Mom that a newborn hears both loud and soft sounds. At around 2 months, she will turn toward a sound. At around 4 months, she will recognise names. Encourage Mom to whisper in her child’s ear or hide behind her and say her name. Ask her to wait for her child to turn toward her.If the child does not look around to find her Mom’s voice, it is possible there is a problem with her hearing. Let Mom know that it might be a good idea to have it checked as soon as possible. Hearing loss can be caused by diseases during pregnancy, a family history of hearing loss or ear infections. Reassure Mom that when hearing loss is identified early, things can be done that can make a big difference.<reflection> What position does your child have to be in to comfortably turn her head? Where can you stand to challenge her to find you?Does she look for the sound of a rattle when you shake it?<keywords>Language; newborn; sucking; preference; communication; Milestones; hearing; brain development; child development; 0- 6 months; health; problem solving; 
<episode>Copy Faces and Sounds<index>Language Matters | 3<title>"I’m opening my mouth just like you are."<tagline>Pay attention to your child’s facial expressions and the sounds she makes. Try to imitate them.<takeaway>This back-and-forth activity with your child helps her learn to communicate through sounds, facial expressions and body language even before she can use words.<overview>Adults who listen, watch and respond to a baby’s early sounds and facial expressions are laying the foundation for communication and conversation. When a mom sticks out her tongue, her child has to think about how it feels to stick out her tongue because she cannot look into a mirror to see it. The ability to try to feel the way another person is feeling is an early way to develop empathy.<practice>To see how her baby reacts to her, ask Mom to imitate her child cooing, smiling or frowning, and then pause to give the baby time to react. Babies usually repeat the sound or expression. You can explain that this starts a cycle of "serve-and-return” interactions. Each child is born with a primitive ability to imitate facial expressions and gestures. Playing with her helps her bond with Mom, Dad and others. Playing imitation games encourages this powerful way of learning.<reflection>What are the various responses that your child displays? Which facial expressions does she respond to the most?Which ones make her smile?Does your child give you a "curious” look when you make certain facial expressions?<keywords>Language; mother-child; communication; eye-contact; nurturing; bond; love; expression; cues; serve & return; responsive; attentive; back-and-forth; Language; mother-child; communication; eye-contact; nurturing;  bond; love; expression; cues; serve & return; responsive; attentive; joint attention; narration; back-and-forth; waiting; brain; development
<episode>Introducing Books<index>Language Matters | 4<title>"When should I start reading to my baby?"<tagline>Talk about the pictures in a book with your child.<takeaway>Using books for "conversations” will help build your child’s language skills. It will also develop her love for reading. <overview>A child can look at a book when she is a few months old. She can do this while she is cuddled up on someone’s lap, while lying on her back or during tummy time. Books can help a child learn about her culture, her community and the broader world. When parents/caregivers read to a child regularly, she will start to have "conversations” about books with them. A child tries to understand the concepts she is exposed to. Books offer opportunities to boost a child’s learning. Talking back and forth while reading a book to a child builds her vocabulary and word comprehension. Picture books extend the vocabulary a child hears and the objects she sees. They help a child learn about animals she would not usually see in real life. They also help her learn that many different objects can be the same shape or colour.<practice>You can help Mom get into the habit of reading to her child soon after birth. Reading to a child daily, sharing her visual focus and speaking at close range in a back-and-forth conversation shows a child that communication works two ways and that her input is valuable. You may want to encourage families to pick out books with pictures of people, animals and objects that they can point to and name.<reflection>Do you have any children’s books at home? Do you remember reading as a child? What was your favourite book? Where can you get books if you need them?Which pictures in books does your child look at the most? Which pictures does your child reach out to touch?<keywords>Language; mother-child; communication; womb; prenatal; reading; book; literacy; development; Language; reading; talk; sing; pictures; pages; personal; story; questions; routine; books; learning; early literacy; joint attention; exploration; comfort
<episode>Baby Sign<index>Language Matters | 5<title>"Wave bye bye!"<tagline>Teach your baby a few simple signs, such as "hungry,” "more” and "all done.” <takeaway>By learning signs, your baby can communicate before she can talk. <overview>A baby develops the ability to control her hand and body movements before she can talk. Teaching her a few simple signs gives her a way to communicate as her verbal language develops. Children stop using sign language when they are able to say words.<practice>Explain to Mom that she can teach her baby simple sign language so she can begin to communicate. Learning to wave bye-bye is a good simple first sign. A baby can also easily learn that tapping her mouth with her fingertips means eat; tapping the fingertips of both her hands together means more; holding both hands in the air and waving them means all gone; and bringing her fists together and rotating them means diaper change.Show Mom a few simple signs to teach her baby. The baby might need a few minutes to respond. Explain that waiting for a response shows her baby that her part of the conversation is valued.<reflection>How do you gesture when you speak? How does gesturing help you to communicate?What gestures are commonly used in your home or community?Have you noticed your baby using gestures, such as pointing, to tell you what she wants?<keywords>communication; language; fine motor; asl; serve and return; narrate;
<episode>Baby Lullabies<index>Language Matters | 6<title>"Sing a lullaby."<tagline>Sing a lullaby and rock your baby.<takeaway>Lullabies are a way to soothe your baby, making her feel loved and connecting her with language. <overview>Singing and rocking your baby helps her become familiar with rhythms and patterns in songs and language. The more a child hears a song, the more likely she is to try to sing it one day. Babies love the sound of a soothing voice. This is a playful way to introduce language. <practice>Try singing a lullaby with Mom while she uses movement to soothe her baby and prepares her for sleep. If possible, sing a lullaby with Mom in her traditional language. Lullabies are a great way to pass on traditional songs and stories to future generations. Explain to Mom that even if she doesn’t know what the words mean, introducing sounds and words will help her baby become familiar with the sounds in that language. This will make it easier for her to understand and speak the language later.<reflection>What songs do you remember from your childhood? How did singing those songs make you feel?How does your baby react when you sing to her?<keywords>Lullaby; culture; tradition; music; language; connection; soothing; 
<episode>Talk About Feelings<index>Language Matters | 7<title>"The loud noise scared you."<tagline>Name what you think baby is feeling.<takeaway>By labelling her feelings, you help your baby understand how to express herself with words. <overview>Your child automatically expresses what she is feeling, whether she is happy, sad, afraid, angry or excited—but she does not know the name for the feeling until she is taught. She needs an adult to help her learn words to describe her feelings.  <practice>Talk with Mom about helping her baby understand emotions by teaching her the word to describe her feelings. Guide Mom to name feelings so that she is comfortable doing this. Encourage Mom to trust her instincts when determining what her child is feeling. You may want to open a discussion about being honest about feelings. Explain that sometimes a baby’s negative emotions are more noticeable than her positive ones. Remind Mom to take notice of and name positive and negative feelings so her baby can learn about them both and learn to be honest about them. For example, if her baby is sad and is told, "You’re okay,” she may become confused. Later in life, when she is sad, she might say, "I’m okay” instead of expressing how she really feels. <reflection>How does your baby react in different situations and how can you interpret her feelings? How successful are you at noticing and naming your own emotions?How do you feel when you talk about other people’s emotions? How can these skills help your baby as she grows?<keywords>social-emotional; emotions; labelling; narrating; observing; responding
<episode>Narrate<index>Language Matters | 8<title>“You are eating dried meat. It tastes so good.”<tagline>Identify and state what your baby is doing. Pause and describe it further.<takeaway>Your baby is connecting words with actions and experiences. <overview>When a child is interacting with her environment, parents/caregivers can help her identify the objects she sees and touches. Once she knows the word for something, she can use it to express herself. <practice>Together with Mom, spend some time watching the baby as she looks around the room. Try to notice when she is focused on an object or an action and say the word for that object. Encourage Mom to say it with you. Repeat the word. Touch the object. Explain to Mom that educators call these early learning words "keywords.” You may want to explain that babies learn words through repetition. Saying a word over and over helps them learn it. Mom can use a word in a sentence to help her child understand when and how to use that word. For example, for the keyword "blanket,” she can say, "blanket is for naptime.” Eventually, her baby will try to say the word when she wants that object.<reflection>How do you feel talking to a baby who doesn’t speak yet? How does your baby respond when you talk to her?What kinds of sounds or facial expressions does your baby make?<keywords>Narration; mother-child; communication; bond; serve & return; routine; nurturing; joint attention; back-and-forth; vocalizing; social; cognitive; language; Joint attention; communication; bonding; gaze shift; vocalizing; pointing; eye contact; care; social; cognitive; language 
<episode>Turn the Pages<index>Language Matters | 9<title>"We can do this together."<tagline>Sit with your baby and a book. Let her try to turn the pages.<takeaway>Your baby will become familiar with books and try to turn pages from an early age. <overview>Picture books are powerful brain boosters. Soon after a child is born, parents/caregivers can sit their baby on their lap and they can look at simple picture books together. The purpose of this is not to teach the baby to read, it is to build positive feelings about books and to spend time with a caring adult. Early reading experiences—when a child hears a soothing voice reading to her—are interactive and enjoyable. Nurturing a love of reading helps her develop language and literacy skills from an early age.<practice>Tell Mom to consider starting with books that are made from cardboard. They are sturdier and easier for a baby to handle. Encourage Mom to use picture books with bright colours and simple illustrations on each page. The best ones have no words or just one or two printed words per page. Explain to Mom that her baby also enjoys looking at pictures of real people, so photo albums are a good choice too. She may need to be reassured that it’s okay if her baby is more interested in turning pages than listening to the story. Turning pages is an important part of understanding how books work.<reflection>What are your own feelings about reading books?How do your experiences with books translate into reading with your baby? When is a good time of day to read together?What can you do to get your baby excited about books?<keywords>Reading; storybook; joint attention; child; development; narrate; describe; book; shared interest; bond; serve & return; responsive; communication; see show say; expressive; Affection; touch; reading; social; language; nurturing; cognitive; development; senses; stress; neglect; parent-child; fine motor; comfort
<episode>Touch and Name<index>Language Matters | 10<title>"That’s my nose."<tagline>When your baby is looking at or touching an object, point to it and tell her what it is.<takeaway>Your baby will connect what she sees and feels with the word used to describe it.   <overview>When parents/caregivers pay attention to what their baby is interested in and then talk about it, they help their baby learn vocabulary.<practice>Ask Mom to pay attention to what her baby is focusing on. Later, Mom can urge her baby to pay attention to something she is focused on. This is how a baby learns to coordinate her attention with others. Explain to Mom that this skill is called "joint” or "shared” attention. Tell Mom she can look at and point to objects at home and in other familiar places, such as at the grocery store, the playground or while going for a walk. She can watch to see what her child is interested in during the day, telling her the name of the objects she is looking at. Encourage Mom to let her baby touch and explore objects while she talks about them. Telling her the words for what she is touching will help her baby understand her world. <reflection>How can you make sure you notice the subtle gestures your baby makes when she is interested in something?<keywords>Reading; joint attention; child development; narrate; describe; book; shared interest; bond; serve & return; responsive; communication; see show say; input; comprehension; production; age appropriate; expressive; language development; nature; nature play; exploration; adult-child interactions; engaging in play
<episode>What’s Happening?<index>Language Matters | 11<title>"Where is the baby bird?Yes, you are pointing at the baby bird under the tree."<tagline>Ask your baby questions about the pictures you see in a book. Watch and listen to her responses.<takeaway>When your baby takes part in conversation about a book, she learns to understand printed words and to share what she is thinking.<overview>Babies like books with short sentences and simple pictures. They also like to look at the same book over and over again. Repetition helps a baby learn new vocabulary and anticipate what is coming next. A baby will understand many more words than she can say.<practice>Read together with Mom and her child. Encourage Mom to name something on a page and ask her baby where it is. Tell Mom to be patient while her baby tries to find it. Invite Mom to build on what her baby already knows and to challenge her to learn more, by saying, for example, "Can you find the bird?" "Can you find the bluebird?" Her baby will show what she understands by pointing or looking. Saying the words herself will follow. Looking at picture books together can happen several times a day, for a few minutes at a time.<reflection>What books does your baby enjoy the most? What pictures does your baby look at when you describe something on the page?Do the pictures in your baby's books reflect what goes on in her daily life? Which items occur both in books and in the world around us?How can you bring her attention to those things?<keywords>Serve and return; open ended questions; listening; literacy, reading; language; cognitive; receptive language;
<episode>Number Talk<index>Language Matters | 12<title>"There are four wheels on the truck."<tagline>Use numbers when you talk and play with your baby.<takeaway>Using numbers helps your baby learn math concepts. <overview>Very young babies begin to understand quantity and see the difference between two objects and ten objects. By using language that refers to quantity and numbers, parents/caregivers will teach their child number awareness early.<practice>Encourage Mom to incorporate numbers and counting while she does daily tasks. For example, tell Mom to count the strawberries as she cuts them and places them into her baby’s bowl. Or, she could offer her baby options by asking, "Would you like one car or two cars? Yes, you would like to play with two cars.”<reflection>When is a good time of the day to count or talk about numbers with your baby? What are some number-related words you can share with her? <keywords>Counting; joint attention; child development; narrate; describe; shared interest; bond; serve & return; communication; see show say; input; comprehension; production; age appropriate; expressive; language development; Counting; joint attention; child development; narrate; describe; shared interest; bond; serve & return; communication; see show say; input; comprehension; production; expressive; language development; Counting; Cree; culture; narrate; describe; communication; comprehension; expressive; language; development
