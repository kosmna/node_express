<episode>Breastfeeding Eye Contact<index>MEANINGFUL MOMENTS | 1<tagline>Your face is baby’s favourite place to look.<takeaway>At birth, baby can only see so far. When baby is nursing, her mother’s face is the perfect distance for her to focus on.<overview>Baby’s vision at birth is not completely developed. Baby’s eyes must start to work together to bring things into focus. Newborns can detect human faces, but their vision is blurry. Baby explores her surroundings by scanning with her eyes.<practice>The best focal point for a newborn’s vision is about 8 to 10 inches away, which is approximately the distance to the mother’s face from her breast. One of the first things a baby can see and learn to recognize is her mother’s face. Try to make as much direct eye contact as possible with your baby while breastfeeding. Speak gently, sing or aqaq baby to keep her focus on you.<reflection>Do you have a quiet place to breastfeed? How does it feel to look at baby while you are feeding?How can you ensure your focus in on baby during this special time? What can you say to baby while breastfeeding?<keywords>Breastfeeding; eye-contact; connection; mother-child; newborn; vision; development; recognition; feeding; eyes
<episode>Moving Objects<index>MEANINGFUL MOMENTS | 2<tagline>Move yourself or hold up an object—a rattle, a ball, or a soft toy—and move it slowly back and forth in front of baby.<takeaway>Babies learn to follow movement with their eyes, ears, and bodies. This strengthens their neck muscles and exercises their abilities to see and hear.<overview>Baby will follow moving objects at first with her eyes. Then she will start to turn her head.<practice>At around 6 months old, baby can twist and turn her whole body to follow an object. Baby may be interested in watching objects that move frequently, make noise, have colour contrasts, or are black and white. This activity is best when baby is lying on her back, is fed, well rested, and happy. If this happens several times a week, baby will get exercise and practice her growing motor skills.<reflection>Where is a safe, comfortable place to play with baby? Which toy does she love to look at?How fast is the perfect pace to move the toy?The first time you played this game, how did baby respond?After a week of playing this game consistently, how did baby respond differently?

She is starting to realize that when she hears something, she can also see it. She will begin to understand that her senses can work together to learn more or solve problems.<practice>Try calling out to baby from the back or side (out of sight) a few feet away and watch her to see if she will turn toward the voice to see whose it is. As baby grows, adults can try moving to different places around her body. This will challenge her to problem solve and move her body in different ways.<reflection>Have you seen baby look for your voice before? When can she hear you, but can't see you?How does she respond when you come back into sight?How do you celebrate the success of baby looking in the right direction to find you?<keywords>head control; newborn; physical; social-emotional; play;<episode>Tummy Time<index>MEANINGFUL MOMENTS | 4<tagline>Place baby on her tummy on a mat or blanket. Sit or lie at her level and offer her toys. Encourage baby to reach for toys. Don’t give toys to baby directly.<takeaway>Tummy time is a time for baby to exercise muscles and discover new ways to move.<overview>Active babies are thinking babies. Tummy time encourages baby to control her head at around 1 or 2 months old. Then, when she is around 3 or 4 months old, she will be able to push up with her forearms to get her chest off the floor.<practice>Baby should try tummy time on a mat or blanket set on the floor. If baby has not done tummy time before, begin slowly, for very short periods of time. Remember that baby should have good head control before beginning tummy time. If she isn’t able to lift her head up and hold it steady, she is not yet ready.Adults can get down on the floor and face baby. Talk to her about what is happening, smile, laugh, and help her to feel comfortable while she tries something new. Be sensitive to baby’s cues that tell you she has had enough.Encourage parents to notice baby’s progress. At first, she may want only one or two minutes of tummy time. Later, she may enjoy playing it for 10 minutes or more. Then, she will start to reach for a toy nearby, and then start to roll. These little changes are signs that baby is getting stronger every day.<reflection>How does baby react to tummy time? How do you make sure to enjoy tummy time with baby?Are there different times of the day baby enjoys tummy time more than others?

<episode>Reaching Up<index>MEANINGFUL MOMENTS | 5<tagline>Lay baby on her back and hold brightly coloured toys or other objects over her chest and within her reach. Also move items just out of reach to encourage exercise and solution seeking.<takeaway>Providing baby with interesting objects in this way develops her hand-eye coordination by encouraging her to use her arms deliberately. It also begins to create thought patterns that encourage her to seek solutions.<overview>One of the first deliberate motor skills baby develops is the ability to open and close her hands on purpose. Grasping things and turning them over is an important skill that contributes to baby's cognitive development. Baby’s mouth has many nerve endings, so after she grabs something watch as she brings it right to her mouth so she can feel it.<practice>At about 3 or 4 months old, most babies begin to reach for things and try to hold them. Adults may notice baby intently studying her own hands as she reaches up, turning the items over and watching the movements. She is discovering that she now has the necessary eye, head, and shoulder control to reach for items purposefully. Baby will develop a grasp in which her fingers close against her palm. She will adjust her grasp to the size and shape of the object.By 4 to 6 months old, baby will have more control of her body's movements. She is better at reaching and grasping. It helps her to have opportunities to practice reaching and touching. Adults can play with baby by holding a toy in different locations around her body, and telling her that she is reaching "so high" or "so far."<reflection>How does baby move her hands and arms?

Then hold it so baby can grab the handle.<takeaway>Baby learns from looking at, hearing, holding, and putting her mouth on different objects.<overview>Baby is learning that her actions cause different outcomes. For example, every time she shakes the rattle, it makes a noise! Adults begin to see baby becoming a curious explorer, trying out new actions and waiting to see a response. Baby will love to be surprised.<practice>Use a toy or anything that does not fit entirely in baby’s mouth. Introduce soft toys to start, because baby’s movements can be jerky—she may hit herself with the toy if she is trying to put it in her mouth. It is best to introduce one toy at a time so she can focus on and explore each one. A small rattle with a handle is a good choice. Call baby’s attention to the noise the object makes. “Did you hear the rattle? You can shake it to make noise!” A small rattle with a handle is a good choice. Other possibilities are a rubber ring, a soft doll, and a board book with pictures.<reflection>What can you say to baby to describe what she is doing? What does baby do to explore the object?<keywords>cause and effect; physical; cognitive;<episode>A Safe Place to Fall<index>MEANINGFUL MOMENTS | 7<tagline>Place pillows around baby while you sit her on her bum.<takeaway>Baby needs your support to learn new skills, and she needs a safe place to fall when she tips over.<overview>Baby is starting to develop motor skills and large muscle groups. Parents can make sure the environment is safe for baby to explore. At around 4 to 6 months, when baby has good control of her head and neck, adults can provide support as baby sits up for short periods of time. This builds the core muscles in baby’s back and abdomen.<practice>Parents can try using a U-shaped nursing pillow as support, or any pillows or blankets from around the house. Or, they can sit baby right in their lap, between their legs. This gives baby a new perspective when viewing the world around her. It also builds her sense of control. Remind adults to never leave baby alone if she cannot sit without support. Once baby is sturdy sitting on her own, encourage adults to place toys around her so she can try to reach for them.<reflection>How do you know that baby is ready to try this activity? How do you interact with baby while you and baby try sitting up?How do you respond when baby tips over?<keywords>sitting; safety; play; physical; attachment; trust;<episode>Hide and Seek<index>MEANINGFUL MOMENTS | 8<tagline>Show baby a toy that makes noises, put it out of sight, make the noise, and then let baby see the toy again.<takeaway>Babies start to learn a big idea early—objects exist even when they are out of sight.<overview>At around 5 months old, baby will start to learn that things are still there even when she cannot see them anymore. Hearing a sound that a toy makes when it is out of sight helps baby understand that the toy still exists. Knowing that things and people continue to exist when out of sight is the beginning of understanding how the world works. This kind of game also draws baby’s attention to her environment.<practice>There are many ways adults can play with this experience, such as choosing an exciting toy and letting baby watch them cover it with a light blanket. Then they can ask baby, “Where did your dolly go?” This gives baby the opportunity to problem solve and use her memory to find the toy on her own. Parents might also do this during caregiving routines, such as at bath time. Hide her toy duck over the side of the tub, squeak the toy and ask “Where’s your duck?” wait for a response and then show baby the duck.<reflection>What is baby’s reaction when the toy goes out of sight? Does she look for it?If she doesn’t look for it, how does she react when it makes a sound?If baby watches you cover the toy with a blanket, will she try to find it? How can you make this experience easier for baby?Once she gets the hang of it, how can you make it more difficult?<keywords>object permanence; physical; cognitive; play;<episode>Bring Hands Together<index>MEANINGFUL MOMENTS | 9<tagline>Hold a small, safe object in front of baby so she can grab it with both of her hands.<takeaway>Babies learn to control their hand movements and to coordinate both sides of their body to use both of their hands together.<overview>Baby is learning to use both sides of her body and her brain together. She is also developing the physical skills to coordinate the body movements she needs for crawling and walking.<practice>At around 5 or 6 months old, baby will develop the ability to coordinate her hands together in the middle of her body. She will soon be able to cross the mid-line to use her hand on the opposite side of her body. Parents can model this physical action by bringing their own hands together in front of baby or singing an action song like Patty Cake. You can also develop fine motor dexterity by playing games like “putujaa, putujaa”, “Open them, shut them” and “upluriak”.<reflection>What is something exciting—but safe—that you can do to encourage your baby to reach for in front of her body?If you clap your hands first, will she copy you?When are times throughout the day when you can naturally pass her an item for her to grab with both hands?<keywords>Fine; motor; development; skill; grasp; control; reach; clasps; hand; release; milestone; child; physical<episode>Back and Forth<index>MEANINGFUL MOMENTS | 10<tagline>Pass or roll an interesting object to baby and encourage her to pass or roll it back to you.<takeaway>When babies pass objects back and forth, they learn about sharing and taking turns.<overview>Turn-taking with objects is a non-verbal conversation. Passing an object back-and-forth gives baby practice in taking turns and mimics how a conversation works.<practice>It can be difficult for baby to learn to trust that the item she is giving away will be returned to her. She hasn’t yet developed the ability to think ahead of the current moment. Adults should be patient and flexible, allowing baby to hand the item over when she is ready, and then show excitement and smile at baby when she does it. Try thanking baby for being so kind and sharing, and then soon after give the item back to her. This is an opportunity to emphasize the joy of sharing and to show the positive feelings associated with sharing. This builds baby’s trust that she will have the item again, and helps her start to understand delayed gratification.<reflection>When baby is playing, in what ways does she interact with you? How do you interact with her?Are there opportunities during bath time, mealtimes, or other routines when you can practise handing an item back and forth? How is baby progressing with this experience over time?<keywords>social-emotional; sharing; conversation;<episode>Starting to Crawl<index>MEANINGFUL MOMENTS | 11<tagline>During tummy time, place an exciting toy slightly in front of baby, encouraging her to move towards it.<takeaway>Baby will want to reach for the toy and will start to move toward it.<overview>Developmental milestones such as crawling will happen naturally in most babies. By paying attention to when baby is ready, we can provide opportunities to challenge her. We can also label the motions she is making, so she becomes more aware of her body and movements. This is a time to teach words like “stretch, reach, try harder, keep trying”.<practice>Observe baby closely to know when she is ready to start crawling. Baby will push up on her arms to lift up her chest, get up onto her toes or her knees, and then start rocking back and forth. When this happens, baby is ready to start moving.Adults can place a toy just slightly out of baby’s reach and encourage her to move toward it. If she can’t move toward it and gets frustrated, place a different object in a spot where she can reach and experience success. Keep encouraging her to try for the first object. You can also encourage baby to move toward a family member or pet.<reflection>How can you ensure baby has your attention during this time? What actions does baby do that let you know she is ready to try to crawl?What is the perfect toy to tempt her with?

<episode>Music Games<index>MEANINGFUL MOMENTS | 12<tagline>Sing songs with baby that have hand or body movements in them.<takeaway>Songs, chants and rhymes that have a repetitive action allow baby to predict and anticipate what will come next.<overview>Singing songs that go along with hand movements or other actions offers many ways for baby to participate. Baby can sing the tune, move her hands, get up and dance, or play an instrument. Songs are a fun way to practice language skills. Adding a pause for baby to fill in helps her retrieve information from her memory and use it in a way she sees as being useful and fun. These activities also help baby to learn sequence and to anticipate what comes next.<practice>When a special movement happens at the same time as a specific word in the rhyme, adults can pause to see if baby will anticipate what is coming. When she does, adults can praise baby with smiles or claps and continue to sing the song. Baby can show you what she knows before she can even speak. In time, she will become more confident in communicating. Baby enjoys showing what she knows!Singing songs together is a fun way to explore the rhythm and rhyme in everyday language. It is an easy way to practise words and expression. It is also an opportunity to teach feelings. Try to include songs that express some emotions. Show these emotions when you share the songs. Make sure baby is able to see the adult while they are singing together. When baby can see the adult’s mouth moving, she will mimic the shapes the adult’s mouth is making.<reflection>What songs did you enjoy singing as a child?

You may exaggerate how high she bounces to make her laugh.<takeaway>Babies need opportunities to build the large muscles in their legs. This will help them with walking later.<overview>Baby loves to bounce up and down, strengthening the muscles in her legs and abdomen. Using aqausit with baby is a good opportunity for this.<practice>Adults can make this more fun by exaggerating the bounce that baby makes. This helps baby understand that her actions have an effect. Gradually over time, baby will start to do the movement all on her own, while the adult just supports her for balance. Using jolly jumpers and jumping stations can support this kind of development.<reflection>When you place baby on her legs, does she use her muscles to try to hold her own weight? How much support does baby need?How does this change over time?How can you tell if baby is enjoying this play?<keywords>physical; scaffolding; walking; milestone<episode>Dance Time<index>MEANINGFUL MOMENTS | 14<tagline>Listen to ajaajaa and other music, hold your baby, and move around to the beat.<takeaway>Babies learn rhythm by listening and moving to music.<overview>Rhythm in music introduces rhythm and rhymes in everyday language. Paying attention to sounds in music is practice for learning sounds in language—a building block of language and, later, literacy. Rhythm is also a building block of math. Rhythm is made up of repetitive patterns, and it sets the stage for baby to start understanding patterns, sets, and cycles.Music is another way to pass down tradition, stories, and language. Make sure that baby hears music such as pisiit, throat singing/qiarviaaq and ajaajaa drumming and introduce her to traditional dances at community events.<practice>Adults can play some music that they enjoy dancing to. While holding baby, move to the beat. Look at baby and smile while you sing and dance with her. This could be a fun strategy to use when baby is feeling fussy. Being held close and gentle movements are comforting and could be a stress reliever for the adult.<reflection>Do you know how to access traditional music? Does baby have favourite songs?Which movements does baby enjoy?When you put music on, does baby recognize it and start to move her body on her own?<keywords>Lullaby; singing; music; tradition; culture; language; development<episode>Follow Me<index>MEANINGFUL MOMENTS | 15<tagline>Do something while you say the words and encourage baby to imitate you.<takeaway>Babies can imitate what adults are doing and connect the words to the actions.<overview>Baby’s most important teachers in life are her parents and caregivers. Baby absorbs and learns from everything her parents do.<practice>Parents can take advantage of this by encouraging baby to practise imitating simple actions, such as waving, tapping with a spoon, patting her head or clapping hands. While adults are cooking, they can give baby her own pot and wooden spoon. As they stir the pot, they can say, “Stir, stir, stir,” and watch as she copies their actions. Imitation games continue to support baby’s emerging thinking skills and build her vocabulary.<reflection>When are occasions throughout the day when baby is paying attention to your actions? How can you label your actions in a simple way for baby?What can you provide for baby so she can also imitate the actions? How much does baby enjoy this activity?How can you tell?<keywords>Imitation; labelling; actions; vocabulary; language<episode>Standing<index>MEANINGFUL MOMENTS | 16<tagline>Provide safe opportunities for baby to pull herself up to a standing position on the sides of furniture or other objects.<takeaway>Baby’s physical development will excel when she has opportunities to move safely and freely.<overview>Babies become more and more mobile as they grow. When they are almost ready to start walking, they will pull themselves up and stand whenever they can. This prepares them for the next big milestone<practice>Adults can make sure that baby has safe places to do this. They can provide step stools, ottomans, couches, or any other object that won’t tip when baby pulls up on it. Once baby can do this with ease, parents can place a toy a few steps away and encourage baby to move toward it.It is important to note that baby will try to pull herself up even if it is not safe. Ensure a safe and enjoyable activity by planning for it and having safe items around to use.<reflection>What does the environment look like from baby’s perspective? What can baby grab, pull, or push?What can you provide for baby so she can accomplish the task of pulling herself up?

She will especially enjoy the dumping out part. This helps baby learn that her actions affect the world around her.<practice>When baby drops things and then dumps them, she is improving her ability to grasp and release objects. She is also building on her understanding of object permanence. Dropping and dumping is a form of exploration that allows baby to test out concepts and make things happen. She is learning how her actions change things, and she is starting to build problem- solving skills.<reflection>What objects can you provide for baby, that are both small enough to handle and big enough that she won’t choke on them?Where can you put these items so that baby can reach them? What kind of container can you put these items into?When baby dumps her container, what do you say to her?

Baby will learn that she can trust you to be there when she falls.<overview>Learning to walk is a big milestone in a baby’s development. Adults will always be adjusting how much support they offer based on baby’s rapidly changing development. Find a place between making sure baby is interested and challenged and making sure she feels confident and successful.<practice>Adults can follow baby’s lead, providing encouragement and support while allowing baby to develop this skill at her own pace. Once baby is comfortable holding up her own weight, adults can stand her on the floor while they hold her hands. To begin it is good to have baby take steps towards a person who holds out hands to her. Moving back-and-forth between two people who are ready to catch her gives her confidence. Have her lean slightly forward as she puts one foot forward to support her body weight. Eventually give her less and less support until she can stand and take a step on her own – this is an example of gradually letting baby do things without your help.<reflection>What does baby do that lets you know she is ready for this activity? Where are new and exciting places you can try walking?Is there someone whom baby likes to walk to?How do you share your pride in baby’s accomplishments with her?<keywords>walking; scaffolding; physical; trust;
