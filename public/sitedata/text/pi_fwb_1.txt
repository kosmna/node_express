<episode>After Baby is Born<index>FAMILY WELL-BEING | 1<tagline>Try to follow healthy routines such as eating well, getting outside, and sleeping when your baby sleeps.<takeaway>Mothers and other caregivers who take care of themselves find it easier to take care of baby’s needs.<overview>The postpartum period is the time after the birth of a newborn when the mother’s body adjusts, both physically and psychologically, to child-rearing. It takes about six weeks until the mother's body is close to a pre-pregnant state. This is also a period of adjustment for fathers. They may not be as supportive as a mother needs at this point. Both parents need support in adjusting to a very different life.<practice>Most mothers have many different feelings, ranging from excitement and joy to guilt and sadness, during pregnancy and after baby is born. Sometimes feelings of sadness and guilt become overwhelming. This can happen at any time during the first year after the birth.Many mothers get the “baby blues.” Mothers may find themselves feeling sad, irritated, tired, and overwhelmed. This is because of changes that are happening in her body. Healthy eating habits, getting enough sleep, managing stressors and being around other adults often helps. Baby blues may last a few days or continue for several weeks after baby’s birth. An EY Visitor or trusted loved one can be a support in case the feelings become too much to handle alone. Fathers need to learn the best ways to provide love and care during this time.<reflection>What do you need right now?

Babies start to see themselves as part of a bigger community. This builds confidence and resilience.<overview>Identity refers to a person’s sense of self—who they are, what is important to them, where they come from, and what they believe about their own abilities and worth. Families are babies’ first source of information about who they are and where they belong. Families have a tremendous influence on babies’ belief about themselves. This is especially true with regards to the name(s) a baby carries and to the blessings that she have been given. Strong and loving families can help babies learn the stories of their birth and belonging and develop a positive self-image. As babies grow, a positive self-image gives them confidence in their abilities, helps them bounce back when they experience difficulties, and makes them feel connected to their family and community.<practice>When parents are ready, encourage them to help their baby create loving relationships with family and community members. Extended family members may provide baby with exposure to cultural traditions and language and contribute to baby’s sense of belonging.<reflection>How soon are you ready to have visitors? Who are the most important people in your lives?Who will be a support to you and baby?Who would you like baby to feel comfortable with? How do you feel when others are holding your baby?<keywords>Father-child; bond; oxytocin; nurturing; love; care; bond; biology; brain; energize; play; activate; balance; connection

For your health, and for the health of your next baby, it is important to ask your doctor about the right time to plan your next pregnancy. Breastfeeding will help with this.<overview>When a mother feels ready, and her bleeding has stopped, she can start sexual activity again. Not every couple wants to start resuming sexual activities in the first few months. There are many physical and mental reasons for this. However, it is important for a new mother to know that she can become pregnant again before her menstrual period returns. She can also become pregnant again while she is breastfeeding.<practice>The new mother can think about her feelings around starting sexual activities again. There are many changes that can affect a new mother in the postpartum period. These include changes in how she sees and feels about her body, vaginal bleeding, vaginal dryness, having a sore perineum, and feeling tired. A breastfeeding mother may also feed her baby so often that she does not want to be touched by her partner. She might also have tender nipples and her breasts may leak during sexual excitement. Adults can talk about these feelings with their partner. Showing tenderness toward each other through hugging, cuddling, and kissing will help. Most mothers will see their care provider for a follow-up appointment six weeks after the baby is born, this is a good time to have the doctor check how your healing process is progressing if you are unsure.<reflection>What are ways to enjoy affection without having sex?Do you feel comfortable talking to your partner about your feelings and needs?<keywords>Birth; control; injection; male; female; pill; condom; patch; contraception; ring; diaphragm; IUC
