“Those flowers are beautiful, I love their colours! What do you think is beautiful?”

<tagline>
A child should engage with art and aesthetic as both the audience and the creator. 

<takeaway>
Creating and admiring beauty can provide children with inspiration and information. Filling their environment with art and beauty can support their creativity and cognitive development.

<overview>
The art in a child’s environment can provide inspiration and provoke creative thought. Art can take form in every aspect of the environment. When parents/caregivers help their child recognise visually appealing spaces, he feels respected and inspired.

<practice>
<in the home>
You can encourage parents/caregivers to help their child see the beauty in his environment, no matter what that environment is. Fabrics, signs or labels, how items on shelves are arranged or decorative elements in the space can all be seen as beautiful. Encourage parents/caregivers to think about the light in the space: Is it natural light from the sun? Can it be dimmed? How does it add to or distract from the beautiful things in the environment? What has been used to decorate and cover the walls? What shapes and colours are displayed for the child? How can he be inspired by his environment to create his own art? 

You can talk to parents/caregivers about how they can draw from their child’s environment to create beauty. With their child, they can rearrange dishes in pretty patterns, colour-code books or reorganize toys in artistic ways. Encourage parents/caregivers to work with their child to decide how things in the home, especially the child’s things, are arranged. They can ask the child, “What do you think looks best? Should your dolls be in this yellow bin and your stuffed animals in the green bin?” or “I think a painting would look great in your room; can you help me find a painting you like?” Parents/caregivers can also use their child’s art to bring beauty into their home. They can ask their child, “I think your picture is beautiful! I love the colours you used; this blue is just like the blue in the living room. Can we hang your painting in the living room?” This encourages the child’s creativity and gives them a sense of pride in their artistic abilities.  

<in the centre>
You can create an environment in your centre that is beautiful and welcoming to children. The light in the space, the activities and documentation on the wall, and the use of calming colours and decorations all add to the aesthetic of the centre. Think about ways to include more art in the space, whether by hanging a painting the children might like or putting up the children’s own art on the wall to encourage their creativity.  

You might set up one wall as an “art gallery,” framing each child’s work on the wall and asking them to name and describe their art, writing their responses beside each picture. You could add lights around the wall to bring attention to the artwork to create a gallery-like setting. You can talk about how art can take other forms, such as dancing, and make space for children to express themselves during music and movement periods, choosing music that encourages them to dance and move. You can point out beauty in the world and in the environment to children and ask them to do the same: “The sky looks beautiful this morning; I love the reds and oranges of the sunrise. Do you notice anything beautiful outside?” If the children say yes, you can invite them to create the beauty they notice in the world.  

<reflection>
What kind of art was in your environment as a child? What do you remember about it? 
Do you think about beauty and aesthetic when setting up a space for a child? 
Is there art in your home or in your centre? Which piece does the child really seem to like?

“This space is wide and open. Perfect for running!”

<tagline>
The environment can be a child’s teacher. 

<takeaway>
Intentionally planning how a child’s space is organized and used can encourage or discourage certain behaviours and support her social-emotional learning.

<overview>
Parents/caregivers can see the environment as working with them to teach their child. Intentionally setting up a space for a child to spend time in sets the tone for how she will engage with the space and its materials. A large open gym will encourage children to move and run across the whole space, while a cozy corner with soft objects and books will encourage them to sit calmly. Paying attention to different areas, whether “noisy” or “quiet,” can help parents/caregivers to regulate their child’s emotions and guide their learning. Engaging with environments in this way provides opportunity for children to practise their self-regulation and learn to use spaces based on their needs.

<practice>
<in the home>
Encourage parents/caregivers to set up spaces for the various moods and behaviours their child experiences. They can set up a cozy fort with pillows and books to encourage their child to be calm and relaxed, or remove pillows from the bed to encourage jumping and active movement. You can also talk to parents/caregivers about how certain set-ups will encourage solitary play while others will encourage bonding time.

<in the centre>
You can create an open and engaging centre environment to allow children to direct their own learning. Setting up invitations in different areas will encourage children to engage with the materials on their own terms. You can set up areas that encourage different types of play, such as a dramatic play area, a cozy reading corner or an art area, while leaving space for the children to move freely in pretend play or dance. Each area should allow for children to play together and collaborate, if they want to. Provide easy access to art materials across areas so the children can feel free to document their activities. You can get down on the children’s level to see the centre how they see it, and make sure they can see and access all of the materials and toys on their own. If they can easily navigate around the centre, they will be more likely to spend time in each area.

“Can you put your toys into your toy box?”

<tagline>
Set up space so children can navigate it on their own. 

<takeaway>
When children can access and put away items on their own, their growing sense of independence is supported.

<overview>
Parents/caregivers can set up a child’s space so that he can navigate it independently. When a child can use the space on his own, he learns that is expected. Alternatively, if books or toys are inaccessible, if his personal items or water is in a separate area, a child will always need an adult's support to access those items. During the preschool years, children start to learn about what they can and cannot do by themselves. They love to practise tasks they can do themselves. Children’s spaces can be organized to support their increasing independence and sense of responsibility. 

<practice>
<in the home>
Encourage parents/caregivers to think about their child’s perspective of a space rather than their own. Which items in the home are easy for him to use on his own and should be kept at the child’s level, and which require more help and should be placed a little higher? When items are out of reach, it sends a message to the child that those are not for him. Parents/caregivers can place some things higher to encourage their child to ask for help with those items.  

You can explain to parents/ caregivers that they can mount coat hooks at the child’s level and keep baskets or bins of toys on low shelves or the floor. Encourage them to notice what their child can do and brainstorm ways to support him to try new things on his own in how they arrange his space. They can praise their child’s attempts, even if he is unsuccessful. This will support his growing autonomy and give him the confidence to try again.  

<in the centre>
You can encourage autonomy and independence by setting up the centre to be accessible to the children. As children get older, they will want the freedom to choose to do things on their own, so the centre should be set up to encourage that. Make sure that everything available for children to access is at a height they can reach themselves. Choose low shelves, bins, child-size tables and small bookcases that are at the children’s eye level to allow them to engage with objects freely. By clearly labelling these baskets and bins, you can help children know how to put objects away when they are done with them. This also allows children to take part in cleaning up after playtime has ended, increasing their sense of responsibility and accountability.  

You can pay attention to what self-care activities children can do on their own and what they still need help with. Take steps to set up the environment to allow them to practise their independent self-care. Use a step-stool so children can reach a sink to wash their hands, place all hooks at a height that allows them to hang their own coats and backpacks, and give them enough time to try to dress themselves before going outside.

<reflection>
How do you encourage a child’s growing autonomy? 
What does your home or centre look like? Is it set up so a child can reach everything they need to on his own, or does he often need help? 
What can a child already do and what might he still need help doing?

Bringing the Outdoors In

<index>
ENGAGING ENVIRONMENTS | 4

<title>


<quotation>
“Those are nice rocks. What can we make with them?”

<tagline>
Incorporate natural finishes, textures, and materials into the child’s environment whenever possible. 

<takeaway>
Children gain an appreciation for nature when their indoor and outdoor environments overlap.

<overview>
The relaxing feeling of being in nature can be replicated by bringing the outdoor environment indoors. Items made from natural materials often strike more curiosity in children because of the additional sensory stimulation they get from engaging with them versus typical plastic or synthetic materials. Natural items can take the form of finishes in the space such as paint colours or in the items children engage with such as supplies and materials. When nature is incorporated in learning, children will be more engaged and feel connected to the world around them. 

<practice>
<in the home>
Natural materials can be incorporated into every area in the child’s environment. Encourage parents/caregivers to think about how they could incorporate more natural materials into their home. Natural materials include wood, metal, cotton, wool, wicker and stone. Parents/caregivers can also choose natural materials as toys for their child.  

Encourage parents/caregivers to incorporate various natural materials into their child’s play areas. Sensory play can use sand, dirt, hay, grass, ice or snow. Building materials can include wood, clay or rocks. Pretend play can incorporate dress-up clothes made from wool or linen. Parents/caregivers can include the child in bringing the outdoors in. When they’re on a walk, they can ask her, “That’s a pretty flower! If we brought that home, what could we do with it?” This will encourage her to think about how to bring outdoor elements into the home, and support her critical thinking skills. The more parents/caregivers can provide natural materials in their child’s play, the more connected she will feel to her environment.  

<in the centre>
You can create an environment that includes natural elements throughout the centre by choosing natural colours and wood finishes, and including a lot of natural light and fresh air. You can incorporate natural materials such as seashells, rocks, flowers or leaves in play spaces. You can use woven storage baskets for toys or include a tree branch in the reading area. You can plant seeds with the children and take care of them daily. All this will support a naturalistic environment and teach the children how to care for another living thing.  

To support lessons about the changing seasons, you can include a vase of in-season flowers. You can use twigs, a log, leaves and tree bark to complement a campsite dramatic play centre. Encourage children to use leaves as stamps, providing paint and paper for them to create a nature picture. If you have a nature box in the centre, you can encourage the children to look for interesting things outside they would like to put in the box for the week: “Those are very smooth rocks. Would you like to put them in the nature box to see if we can use them in our activities?”

Displays of Learning

<index>
ENGAGING ENVIRONMENTS | 5

<title>


<quotation>
“I love your picture! Let’s hang it on the wall.”

<tagline>
Document and display the work children make.  

<takeaway>
When children have reminders of what they have experienced and accomplished, they feel respected and proud, and are more likely to build on past learning moments.

<overview>
Learning for children is cyclical. They will often return to the same concepts many times, and each time they will have new experiences, new understandings and be able to gain a deeper understanding. Children love reminders of the work they have done. When they see their work displayed, they know it is valued and important and are encouraged to do more. Displays of children’s learning also provide documentation of their growth, which is helpful for the child, educators and their parents/caregivers. 

<practice>
<in the home>
You can encourage parents/caregivers to find different ways to display their child’s learning. They may choose to display his work on the fridge or frame and hang his artwork on the wall. Displays of learning could also be pictures of family trips or adventures in a photo album. Families can go back to these displays and talk about their experiences or offer the child opportunity to share their work photos with their other family members who come to visit. They can use the displays of learning to talk to their children about his efforts and find out what interests him. If he has drawn a picture of a child playing at the park, parents/caregivers can talk to him about his picture before displaying it. For example, “I like your picture! I’d like to put this on the fridge for everyone to see. Is this you playing at the park with Auntie? What did you do at the park?”

<in the centre>
You can incorporate displays of learning in the centre by intentionally observing children throughout the day and writing down what they say, photographing them playing games or doing an activity or taking samples of their work. You can collect these displays in a portfolio, put them into a learning story or display them as documentation on the walls of the centre. Displaying the children’s learning allows everyone who enters the centre to see and interact with the children’s work, giving parents/caregivers the opportunity to engage with their children’s learning.  
If the children create their own snowflakes with paper cut-outs or paint, you can decorate a bulletin board with them in a winter wonderland theme. Include each child’s name and how this activity supports their learning and development.

Reflecting Community

<index>
ENGAGING ENVIRONMENTS | 6

<title>


<quotation>
“What makes my community unique?”

<tagline>
Incorporate elements that reflect the people, values and cultures within your community into the child’s environment. 

<takeaway>
Children feel a sense of belonging when they see themselves reflected in their environment. 

<overview>
Children gain a stronger sense of self when their environment reflects the knowledges, beliefs and practices of their families and communities. When children recognise themselves in the spaces where they learn and grow, they feel a greater sense of belonging. This encourages resilience and a connection to community and self.

<practice>
<in the home>
Encourage parents/caregivers to take time to think about who they are and where they live. They can ask themselves, “What makes my community unique?” or “What are my community’s strengths?” or “When does my community come together?” You can suggest that parents/caregivers think about how to add elements of their values, culture and their community into the child’s life.  

If there is a certain food that is served at community gatherings, parents/caregivers can make that food with the child, explaining its importance. If there are certain tools or items of clothing that are significant to parents/caregivers, they can make these available to their child during play so she can engage with them on her own terms. Parents/caregivers can include music, art or books that reflect their community throughout the day and include stories and photos of the child during community gatherings.  

<in the centre>
You can include elements of the children’s different communities and cultures into the centre. You can have books in the reading area that are written in other languages or dual written in another language and English to support children’s development in both languages. You could create a listening centre with audio recordings of a traditional story being told. When labelling items in the centre, along with a picture of the item and the English word, you can add the label in another language. If a child celebrates a holiday that you are unfamiliar with, you can use the opportunity to learn together about that holiday and create activities to support the children’s learning. Families may eat different foods during their celebrations; you can think about hosting a family potluck or asking parents/caregivers to send a snack for the class to try.  

There may be other people in the community that can support teaching the children. Each child and adult is unique with their own gifts. There may be many people in the community who would be willing to share their teachings. Consider inviting community experts to the centre to speak to and spend time with the children, or take children to other places to visit community experts, Elders or Knowledge Keepers.
