<episode>Talk Face to Face<index>LANGUAGE MATTERS | 1<tagline>Hold baby close to your face and say a few words. Use special aqausirq with your child to develop this bond. Tell your baby stories all the time.<takeaway>Baby will start to connect the sound of your voice with your face.<overview>The mother’s voice is one constant that carries over from inside the womb to the outside world. The mother’s voice is familiar to baby both before and after birth. An adult who uses a warm, supportive voice while talking face to face with baby promotes attachment and language development.<practice>Talking face to face builds on all of the benefits that occurred when adults were speaking to the pregnant mother’s belly. Baby learns that the voice they already know is connected to the face they see so often. Looking into baby’s eyes and talking frequently helps her learn that sounds and speech are important. Baby starts to connect the action to the positive feelings that come along with hearing Mom’s comforting voice. She is connecting sounds to people and things. Mothers and other caregivers can start early—even newborn, baby is learning the patterns of speech. They turn their eyes toward the source of sounds, especially sounds that they feel connected to.<reflection>How close do you need to be before baby catches your eye contact? What tone of voice do you use when you talk to her?In what situations do you speak to baby?How do you feel when you are spending personal and quality time with baby?What are the stories/songs you want to share with your baby?<keywords>Language; newborn; crying; communication; listening; preference; talking; mother's voice; cognitive; development; Language; mother-child; communication; eye-contact; nurturing; breastfeeding; bond; love; expression; cues; serve & return; responsive; attentive; Language; serve & return; receptive; expressive; communication; cues; relationship; responsive; attentive; attachment; bonding
<episode>Where Am I?<index>LANGUAGE MATTERS | 2<tagline>Whisper in baby’s ear or stand behind baby out of sight and say baby’s name. Wait for baby to turn toward you.<takeaway>Baby can hear sounds and turn toward them.<overview>Baby has a well-developed sense of hearing at birth, and she is starting to develop early language skills. This combines the skills she already has – the ability to move their head and neck, and hearing – with something new, finding you!<practice>Baby hears loud and soft sounds. At around 2 months, baby will turn toward a sound. At around 4 months, baby will recognize names.If baby does not look to see where a voice is coming from, there may be a problem with her hearing. It is best to have it checked it out as soon as possible. When hearing loss is identified early, some things that can be done that can make a big difference. Hearing loss can be due to diseases during pregnancy. It could also be related to family history of hearing loss, or it can be caused by ear infections. To prevent this, do not smoke anywhere around the baby and breastfeed baby as long as possible.<reflection>What position does baby have to be in to comfortably turn her head? Where can you stand to challenge her to find you?Does she look for the sound of a rattle when you shake it? Does baby respond to soft sounds as well as louder ones?<keyword>Language; newborn; sucking; preference; communication; Milestones; hearing; brain development; child development; 0- 6 months; health; problem solving;<episode>Copying Faces and Sounds<index>LANGUAGE MATTERS | 3<tagline>Pay attention to baby’s facial expressions and the sounds baby makes. Try to imitate them. Introduce special words/ rhymes like putujaa,putujaa; nauk uqaqkulu?<takeaway>This back-and-forth activity with baby helps her learn to communicate through sounds, facial expressions, actions and body language even before she can use words.<overview>Adults who listen, watch, and respond to baby’s early sounds and facial expressions are laying the foundation for communication and conversation. When an adult sticks out their tongue, baby has to think about how it feels to stick out her tongue because she cannot look into a mirror to see it. This ability to try and feel the way another person is feeling is early development of empathy.<practice>When adults imitate baby’s coos, smiles, or frowns, and then pause to give baby time to react, baby will usually repeat the sound or expression. This starts a cycle of “serve and return” interactions. Baby is born with a primitive ability to imitate adults’ facial expressions and gestures. This helps with early bonding with mother, father, and others. Playing imitation games can encourage this powerful way of learning. Babies absorb what they hear and see and will repeat it back. It is important to be always aware of what emotions, expressions and words you expose children to.<reflection>What are the various responses that baby displays? Which facial expressions does she respond to the most?Which ones make her smile?Does baby give you a “curious” look when you make certain facial expressions, sounds?<keywords>Language; mother-child; communication; eye-contact; nurturing; bond; love; expression; cues; serve & return; responsive; attentive; back-and-forth; Language; mother-child; communication; eye-contact; nurturing;  bond; love; expression; cues; serve & return; responsive; attentive; joint attention; narration; back-and-forth; waiting; brain; development
<episode>Introducing Books<index>LANGUAGE MATTERS | 4<tagline>Talk about the pictures in a book with baby. Inuit babies have always been exposed to complex language.<takeaway>Using books for “conversations” will help build baby’s language skills. It will also develop her love for reading.<overview>Even at a few weeks old baby can look at a book while cuddled on someone’s lap, while lying on her back, or during tummy time. Books can help baby learn about her culture, her community, and the broader world. Babies will already be conditioned to listening to your stories. When parents read to baby regularly, she will start to have “conversations” about books with her parents. Baby will also be memorizing words and may start to use them associated with a specific book. Baby is trying to understand the concepts she is exposed to. Books offer opportunities to boost a child’s learning. Talking back-and-forth while reading a book to baby builds her vocabulary and word comprehension. Choose books with big, simple pictures that can be easily recognized.<practice>Adults can get into the habit of reading to baby soon after birth. Reading to baby daily, sharing her visual focus and speaking at close range in a back-and-forth conversation show baby that communication works two ways and that her input is valuable. Encourage families to pick out books with pictures of people, animals, and objects that they can point to and name.Picture books extend the vocabulary baby hears and the objects baby sees. They help baby learn about various animals she may not usually see. They also help her learn that many different objects can be the same shape or colour. Whenever possible, relate the book learning to the same things in real life. If you are teaching colours from a book, look for those colours when you are out for a walk.<reflection>Do you have any children’s books at home? Do you remember reading as a child?What was your favourite book?Where can you get books if you need them?Which pictures in books does baby look at the most? Which pictures does baby reach out to touch?How are you connecting book words to real life experiences?<keywords>Language; mother-child; communication; womb; prenatal; reading; book; literacy; development; Language; reading; talk; sing; pictures; pages; personal; story; questions; routine; books; learning; early literacy; joint attention; exploration; comfort
<episode>Baby Talk<index>LANGUAGE MATTERS | 5<tagline>When baby babbles, talk and babble back. Making initial special sounds is part of words like apaapa/food, haahaa/ peeing, iimiimi/drink, iita/going outside.<takeaway>Baby develops communication skills when adults respond to her sounds. This builds important foundations for future language development.<overview>By 6 months, baby's sounds are usually changing to include more babbling. Adults can build on baby’s babbling to create conversations.<practice>Baby will use her new language and communication skills as she smiles and coos back-and-forth. She will enjoy making noises that sound like talking, starting with vowel sounds such as a,aa, i,ii, u,uu and progressing to taa, tii, tuu, paa pii, puu, maa, mii, muu. Baby may “talk” and then pause, waiting for a response. Adults may notice the sounds baby is making and interpret them by using the context of what is happening around her. For example, if baby says, “Hahaha,” an adult might respond, “Haahaa, Quiliqpii (Do you need to pee?)”, Baby will start expecting adults to respond to babbling with sounds and words—a positive result to a positive action.<reflection>Which sounds do you notice baby making? When does she make those sounds?How do your respond?What items can you use in your home to emphasize baby’s babbling i.e., ball, puppy, doll, milk, book? How do you make words meaningful by linking them to objects, actions, experiences?<keywords>Language; communication; sounds; babbling; baby talk; conversation; vocalizing; development; speech; describe; 
<episode>Baby Lullabies<index>LANGUAGE MATTERS | 6<tagline>Sing a lullaby and rock baby.<takeaway>Lullabies, chants, finger plays are a way of soothing baby, making her feel loved, and connecting her with Inuktut.<overview>Singing and rocking baby at the same time will help baby become familiar with rhythms and patterns that occur in songs and language. The more familiar baby is with a song, the more likely she will be to try to sing along one day. There are many song games, chants and finger plays in Inuktut used to teach, play and calm a baby. This is an important way to practice language.<practice>A lullaby sung along with a soothing movement helps baby get ready for sleep. Baby loves the sound of a soothing voice. If possible, sing a lullaby in Inuktut. Lullabies can pass songs and stories down to future generations. Even if the adult doesn’t know what the words mean, introducing the sounds and words helps to familiarize baby to the sounds in the language. This makes it easier to learn to understand and speak the language later. Try to learn the many different chants and song games that were used as teaching tools by Inuit, often associated with finger plays, drumming or juggling.<reflection>What songs/chants do you remember from your childhood? How did singing those songs make you feel?How does baby react when you sing to her?Do you notice baby picking up on any of the language or actions when you do this?<keywords>Lullaby; culture; tradition; music; language; connection; soothing;<episode>Exploring Faces<index>LANGUAGE MATTERS | 7<tagline>Hold baby close and name the parts of your face when she touches them.<takeaway>Babies are connecting words with the body part they are touching.<overview>Adults often hold baby close to them as they go about their day. This closeness provides many opportunities for baby to touch the adult’s face. The adult can use this as a time to promote baby’s language development.<practice>Baby begins to link the adult’s words to parts of the face as they are touched and named. This can set a basic understanding for later learning about similarities, such as, “Mommy has a nose, daddy has a nose, and baby has a nose.” Adults can use the same technique as baby grabs her feet, chews on a finger, or tugs on someone’s hair. As she explores the body parts of her family, her vocabulary grows, and she strengthens her image of herself. This will help to build baby's confidence. Ask baby to show you the baby part, “Where is your nose?” For Inuit, developing very strong oral memory was important since there was not written language. Memory games were played often with children to help build this ability. Sequences of words and word plays were often used. Games such as ukaliq, qavvik, tuugaalik, tulugak doing the actions for each animal is a good example.<reflection>During what times of the day are you physically close to baby? Do you notice baby reaching for you?How can you try to set up the opportunity for this play time to happen?How can you respond to baby's touches in a way that helps to mimic conversation? How can you incorporate memory into these activities?<keywords>Language; mother-child; communication; eye-contact; nurturing; bond; love; expression; cues; serve & return; responsive; attentive; back-and-forth; Language; mother-child; communication; eye-contact; nurturing;  bond; love; expression; cues; serve & return; responsive; attentive; joint attention; narration; back-and-forth; waiting; brain; development; body parts; naming; 
<episode>Lots of Different Words<index>LANGUAGE MATTERS | 8<tagline>Use a variety of words to describe events and things.<takeaway>When babies hear more words, they will have bigger vocabularies when they start to speak.<overview>Baby is learning that words name things. When baby hears everyday objects named repeatedly, she learns that the word she hears is the name of that object. Baby is able to hear and understand words long before she is able to use them. Children who hear full, rich language develop greater vocabularies and, in turn, have a better foundation for communicating and reading and writing. Children who hear less language and fewer words still learn to speak normally, but they have a smaller vocabulary and are likely to have more difficulty learning to read and write. Inuktut words are often complex to convey context and meaning. There are often generalized words, but also more specific words for the same thing. Inuit build the complex terminology through experience with the words and the meanings associated with the words. Do not limit your child to only the very general terms. Early on children hear the more specific words and learn to know how different words are used in the proper contexts.<practice>Think of various ways to describe items, such as by colour, shape, texture, and taste. Consider all the various words that can be used for this as well. Descriptive language gives baby a deeper understanding of the world around her. This also helps baby prepare herself for something new. For example, while changing a diaper, a parent might say, “I’m going to wipe you now, it might feel cold!” While preparing food, a parent might say, “I’m just mixing up your cereal. It still feels a little warm. Let’s blow on it to cool it down.”<reflection>What are everyday items that baby is familiar with? What senses does baby use to explore those objects?Which characteristics of the items stand out to you? Which characteristics do you think will stand out to baby? How can you build on this?<keywords>describe; narration; language; expression; literacy; syllabic; writing; tradition; vocabulary; language; details; senses;<episode>Talk About Feelings<index>LANGUAGE MATTERS | 9<tagline>Name what you think baby is feeling.<takeaway>Labelling feelings will help baby to understand how to express her feelings with words.<overview>Baby expresses her emotions freely, whether she is happy, sad, afraid, angry, or excited. Over time, she will learn to regulate these emotions so that she can respond appropriately in challenging situations.<practice>The first step toward managing emotions is acknowledging that they exist. Adults can model this by naming the emotion baby is feeling, and then helping her deal with the situation that is creating that emotion. It’s very clear when baby is feeling upset, and easy to interpret. It is just as important to describe when baby is feeling positive emotions and to label them too. Inuit have many specific words to describe emotions and these are taught to children early in life so they will learn to connect with emotions and feelings and be able to accurately describe how they are feeling. A parent might say, “You are a little upset, but you are not angry. Let’s make it better.”It is important to be honest when naming an emotion, so that baby is able to accurately identify and understand it. If adults mislabel emotions, baby may become confused and may start to feel that her emotions are not valued.For example, if whenever baby is sad an adult tells her “You’re okay,” they are receiving a mixed message. Later in her life, when she is sad, she may respond by saying, “I’m okay” instead of acknowledging her true feelings. Inuit train children early in life to not just identify feelings but to begin to manage them in appropriate ways.<reflection>How does baby react in different situations, and how can you interpret her feelings? What feelings/emotions are you noticing in your child?Are you naming these correctly and also teaching differences in feeling? How effective are you at recognizing your own emotions?How do you feel when talking about other people’s emotions? How can these skills help baby as she grows older?<keywords>social-emotional; emotions; labelling; narrating; observing; responding<episode>Narrate<index>LANGUAGE MATTERS | 10<tagline>Name what baby is doing. Pause and describe some more.<takeaway>Baby is connecting words with actions and experiences.<overview>When adults notice and name something baby is already paying attention to, it helps baby develop her vocabulary. The earlier baby understands words, the sooner she will use them. Understanding word complexity will also help baby to use words correctly.<practice>Adults can use the item that baby is focused on as a keyword. They can say the keyword first and then describe what baby is doing and feeling, using the key word again. Labelling the items baby is currently paying attention to helps her understand when and how to use the word. Eventually, she will try to say the word.<reflection>How does it feel talking to baby who doesn’t speak yet? How does baby respond when you talk to her?What various kinds of sounds or facial expressions does baby make?<keywords>Narration; mother-child; communication; bond; serve & return; routine; nurturing; joint attention; back-and-forth; vocalizing; social; cognitive; language; Joint attention; communication; bonding; gaze shift; vocalizing; pointing; eye contact; care; social; cognitive; language<episode>Turn the Pages<index>LANGUAGE MATTERS | 11<tagline>Sit with baby and a book. Let her try to turn the pages.<takeaway>Baby starts to turn pages and becomes familiar with books from an early age.<overview>Picture books are powerful brain boosters. Beginning soon after baby is born, adults can hold her and look at simple picture books together. The purpose is not to teach baby to read. The purpose is to establish positive feelings about reading books and sharing time with a caring adult. Baby learns to love reading when her early reading experiences are interactive and enjoyable. This love of reading develops language and literacy skills from an early age.<practice>Board books made from cardboard are sturdier and easier for baby to handle. Encourage parents to use picture books that have bright colours and simple illustrations on each page. The best ones have no words or only one or two printed words on each page. Baby also loves to look at pictures of real people, so photo books are a good choice. If baby is introduced to books early, she will soon learn how to hold the book and turn the pages. It is okay if sometimes baby wants only to turn the pages and not listen to the story. Turning pages is an important part of understanding how books work.<reflection>What are your own feelings about reading books?How do your experiences with reading books translate to reading with baby? When are good times throughout the day to read together?What can you do to get baby excited about books?<keywords>Reading; storybook; joint attention; child; development; narrate; describe; book; shared interest; bond; serve & return; responsive; communication; see show say; expressive; Affection; touch; reading; social; language; nurturing; cognitive; development; senses; stress; neglect; parent-child; fine motor; comfort
<episode>Point and Look<index>LANGUAGE MATTERS | 12<tagline>When baby is looking at an object, point to it and tell her what it is.<takeaway>Baby will learn more about an item when you are both focusing on the same thing.<overview>When adults pay attention to what baby is interested in and then talk about it, they are expanding baby’s vocabulary.<practice>The adult first pays attention to what baby is focusing on. Later the adult encourages baby to pay attention to something the adult is focusing on. Baby is learning how to coordinate her attention with others. This is called joint or shared attention.The same strategy of pointing and looking at objects can be used at home or other familiar places, such as at the grocery store, at the playground, or on a walk. Adults can watch to see what strikes baby’s interest throughout the day. They can then tell baby the name of an object, let her touch or explore it, and have a short conversation about the object. Inuit believe real learning only takes place through experiences. Try to provide a rich variety of learning experiences for your child such as picking berries, picking up rocks on the beach, watching a seal being butchered.<reflection>How can you make sure you notice the subtle gestures baby makes when she is interested in something?<keywords>Adult-child interactions; joint-attention; learning; experiences; focus; pointing; vocabulary; attention; naming; <episode>What’s Happening?<index>LANGUAGE MATTERS | 13<tagline>Ask baby questions about the pictures in a book. Watch and listen to her responses.<takeaway>Babies who take part in conversations about a book are learning to understand printed words and share what they are thinking.<overview>Baby likes books with short sentences and simple pictures. She also likes to look at the same book over and over again. Repetition helps baby learn new vocabulary and anticipate what is coming next. Baby understands many more words than she says. She might even begin to memorize the words as they appear in sequence and begin “reading” to you.<practice>Adults can name something on a page and ask baby where it is, giving baby enough time to find it. Invite parents to take what baby already knows and try to challenge her to learn more. "Can you find the bird?" "Can you find the bluebird?" Baby can show what she understands by pointing or looking. Saying the words will follow. Looking at picture books together can happen several times a day for a few minutes at a time.<reflection>Which books does baby enjoy the most? Which pictures does baby look at when you say the word?Do the pictures in baby's books reflect what goes on in her daily life? Which items occur both in books and in the world around us?How can you bring her attention to those things?<keywords>Serve and return; open ended questions; listening; literacy, reading; language; cognitive; receptive language;<episode>Number Talk<index>LANGUAGE MATTERS | 14<tagline>Use numbers when you talk and when you play. Use finger plays and sequences. Point out patterns and groupings.<takeaway>Using numbers helps young children understand math concepts.<overview>Very young babies begin to understand quantity and see the difference between two objects and ten objects. By using language about quantity and numbers, adults build baby’s early number awareness. They can also begin to see patterns and identify the similarities and difference between them.<practice>Adults can count as they do daily tasks and incorporate numbers in many different ways. An adult might count the strawberries as they cut them and place them into baby’s bowl. Or, an adult could give options, such as, “Would you like one car or two cars? Yes, you would like to play with two cars.” When on the land you might look for nests and show the different kinds of eggs in various nests or look at birds that might be the same or different. Teach the names for these things. In Inuktut it is also an opportunity to introduce concepts of many, big, few, small etc.<reflection>When throughout the day can you and baby count or talk about numbers? What are some number-related words you can share with baby?How do you use words like bigger, more, longer, different etc.?<keywords>Counting; joint attention; child development; narrate; describe; shared interest; bond; serve & return; communication; see show say; input; comprehension; production; age appropriate; expressive; language development; Counting; joint attention; child development; narrate; describe; shared interest; bond; serve & return; communication; see show say; input; comprehension; production; expressive; language development; Counting; culture; narrate; describe; communication; comprehension; expressive; language; development
