"I know you are sad that I am going, but I will come back soon."

<tagline>
Help your baby learn to trust that her significant caregivers will always come back.

<takeaway>
Your baby feels strong emotions when her parents/caregivers leave. 

<overview>
Separation anxiety is a normal part of development. A baby experiences anxiety when her parents/caregivers are out of sight. She may cry, cling to her parent, have a tantrum or hit and kick anyone within reach. Her intense fear of having her parent leave might seem excessive to the adults around her, but she is genuinely afraid of being apart from the people she trusts to take care of her.

Separation anxiety can be challenging for parents/caregivers. Many will feel guilty for leaving their baby or worry that she will cry the whole time they are gone. 

<practice>
Discuss techniques for Mom to use when separating from her child. She can try practicing a quick, consistent way to say goodbye, such as giving her baby a kiss, saying "I love you,” waving bye-bye and then immediately leaving. When mom is consistent about her goodbye, it will become familiar to her baby and will allow her to practise regulating her emotions.
Starting small is a good idea. Suggest to Mom to try leaving her baby alone in a room for a few minutes. Say, "I’m going to get the broom; I will be right back.” When she returns, Mom can say, "Here I am, I got the broom and now I’m back.” Work up to taking the dog for a walk while she stays home with another caregiver she knows, gradually building up to longer periods of time away.

Explain to Mom that her baby is just starting to understand time. She has no concept of how long someone will be away or if they will come back. Giving her something to hold on to while Mom is gone, such as her Mom’s scarf or a small photo album of family pictures, will help. Because the baby feels safe and secure Mom and Dad, it can be scary for her when they leave. To create a trusting relationship, Mom needs to let her baby know when she leaves, even if it means her baby will become upset. It can be tempting to slip away without saying anything, but that can create even more anxiety; she might worry that Mom could disappear at any time.

As she grows, her child’s separation anxiety may come back. Even after she seems to be able to manage goodbyes easily, she might start crying about them again. Stress, illness or a sudden change in her life (such as the birth of a baby brother or sister) can bring this on. To help her feel secure again, tell Mom to give her the same loving support she did during her baby’s first experience with separation anxiety.

Safe and Stimulating Environments

"My home is your home too."

<tagline>
Make sure your baby’s environment is a place where she feels a sense of belonging.

<takeaway>
Your baby learns by interacting with the environment she is in. 

<overview>
A baby learns from the people around her and from the places she spends time. When she is in a safe space that provides opportunities to play, she feels respected and knows that she belongs in that space. When she knows that she belongs, she will be confident that she can do things for herself and feel free to explore the materials in her environment, which she can learn from.

<practice>
Tell Mom to think about the rooms where her baby plays and imagine what her baby sees from her level. Consider cupboards, shelves, tables, chairs and couches. Encourage Mom to create a space where it’s safe for her baby to play, explore and learn. It is impossible to completely renovate a home for a baby, but by watching what she interacts with and how, Mom can adapt the furniture and places in her home to be safe while encouraging development. 

As an example, Mom might notice that her baby enjoys opening and closing cupboard doors. This is a good learning experience for her on how to manipulate the door, but it is important there is nothing dangerous in there. Talk to Mom about possible unsafe objects that could hurt her baby or be swallowed. Move cleaning supplies to a higher shelf and put pots, pans and plastic containers in the cupboards that the baby can reach. With only safe items inside a cupboard, she can explore freely. Try putting a truck or another toy inside the cupboard for an exciting surprise. Talk to Mom about the spaces her baby might explore. Babies love to try to fit into small spaces. If her baby is always crawling behind the couch, it might be because she finds it a nice quiet space.

Add some of the baby’s belongings to those spaces so that she knows she is welcome there. By adding cuddly or calming objects—such as blankets, pillows, teddy bears, puzzles and books—to that space, her baby will feel encouraged to play there.

It’s a good idea for Mom to ensure that toys and belongings are in a place where her baby can get them and put them away by herself. This encourages her independence. For example, Mom could dedicate the bottom of a book shelf to her baby’s blocks and dolls or add a lower hook so her baby can take down and hang up her own jacket. If her books are kept in a basket next to the couch or bed, she might require a little help at first, but eventually, she’ll be able to get them on her own.

"Please carry your bowl to the sink."

Your baby understands and can follow simple directions.

<takeaway>
Doing simple tasks will give your baby confidence. 

<overview>
As a baby grows, she becomes more independent and wants to do many things herself. Parents/caregivers can give her simple tasks that she can do. She will be proud of her accomplishments and will enjoy being helpful.

<practice>
Suggest to Mom that she use a kind and supportive voice to give her baby a simple task, such as putting her shoes on the mat. At first, she can demonstrate the task for her baby, by saying, "My shoes go here and here is a spot for your shoes. You can put yours right beside mine.” This can increase her baby’s cooperation and confidence and show her how fun it can be to work together.

Remind Mom to give her baby time and repeat the direction if necessary. Suggest to mom that she avoid power struggles; if her baby does not do it, try again another time rather than forcing her to comply. Once she has done it, Mom can say "thank you” to reinforce her cooperation.

Extended Breastfeeding and Weaning

<quotation>
"Baby will let me know when it is time to stop nursing."

<tagline>
Follow your baby’s lead in deciding how long to continue breastfeeding.

<takeaway>
Extended breastfeeding is healthy for you and your baby. 

<overview>
A baby can benefit from breastfeeding into the second or even third year of life. By 6 months of age, a baby starts eating some solid food and by 12 months, she is likely getting many of the calories she needs from solids. Even still, breast milk can be a valuable source of nutrition and antibodies and extended breastfeeding can provide health benefits to both a mother and her baby. The World Health Organization and Health Canada both recommend breastfeeding for at least 2 years.

Women who choose to breastfeed their toddlers need to eat healthy food and get enough rest to make sure they can produce milk. This is especially true if they become pregnant again and intend to continue nursing through their pregnancy.

<practice>
Mom will breastfeed less as her baby eats more and more solid foods and her baby may wean herself by the time she reaches 12 months. However, if both Mom and her baby are comfortable, breastfeeding can continue. When both are ready, simple weaning strategies can be introduced.

Tell Mom that when weaning, she can try these strategies:
• Don’t offer, but don’t refuse. If your baby wants to nurse, go ahead. If she doesn’t ask, just carry on with the day.
• If your baby gets hurt, talk to her about what happened and see if you can find another way to comfort her rather than immediately nursing.
• Find other ways to be close to your baby so she still feels connected. Try things like playing with her favourite toy, reading a book, going for a walk, colouring or painting.

<reflection>
How do you feel about extended breastfeeding? 
How long do you expect to breastfeed?

Teething

"How can I provide baby with some relief?"

<tagline>
Help your baby to work through the pain of growing new teeth.

<takeaway>
Find what works best to help you and your baby cope while she is teething. 

<overview>
Teething can start at about 5 months and can continue on and off until a baby is about 24 months. Most babies grow in one last set of molars by about 36 months. Every baby is on their own schedule. When she chews on her hands more or drools excessively, this might be signs that she is teething.

Teething is stressful for both parents/caregivers and their baby, who is confused and in pain. Often, it can seem like she is crying for no reason. It’s not always possible to see when teeth start growing in. The pain will come and go with each new tooth. Some babies get fever or diarrhea when they are teething. Sometimes it can be hard to figure out if a baby has a cold, has the flu or is teething. Parents/caregivers should ask a healthcare professional or trusted expert if they are not sure.

It can be difficult to keep in mind that teething is temporary and the pain will go away. The pain might interrupt sleep, which then interrupts the parent/caregiver’s sleep and can cause frustration. Often when a baby is teething, the best relief is to be held and cuddled. Parents/caregivers might want to trade off cuddling with their baby for a while.

<practice>
Mom can help her baby find relief while she is teething. You may want to suggest  that she buy different types of teethers. You can go with her to choose one. Tell her it should be simple and without extra parts. It should be easy for the baby to hold and should not be filled with a liquid. The liquid in some teethers can irritate the skin if the teether breaks open. Mom should sanitize the teether regularly.

Mom can try tying a wet cloth in a knot and freezing it. This is helpful to have on hand in the freezer during a hard day. Sometimes a distraction is the best remedy. Try going outside for a walk or dance to music. This will help both Mom and her baby feel better.

Once teething has started, a baby begins to discover how to use her teeth. She may start biting, which Mom might think is bad behaviour. You may want to remind her that her baby just needs something to chew on because chewing gives her relief from teething pain. If a baby has started to eat solid foods, Mom can give her cold, peeled cucumber, which is the perfect texture for a baby to chew on and it feels great on the gums. Remind Mom that it’s a good idea to supervise her baby with the cucumber to be sure she is not biting off pieces that are too big.

Forks and Spoons

<quotation>
"Do you need a fork or a spoon for your soup?"

<tagline>
Give your baby the chance to use utensils while she is eating.

<takeaway>
Using utensils to eat gives your baby practise using the small muscles in her hand. 

<overview>
Utensils help improve your baby’s fine motor skills and hand–eye coordination as she feeds herself. When a baby is given a bowl of applesauce, she has a problem to solve. She thinks about the problem at hand and then decides how she will get the applesauce into her mouth. This is a way for her to practise using tools to solve a problem.

A baby watches her family using utensils to eat all the time, so she already has an idea how to use them. When parents/caregivers allow her to try, she has a chance to practise. This gives her confidence and increases her ability to take care of herself.

<practice>
Encourage Mom to offer her baby a small plastic spoon to hold and explore. Encourage mom to narrate what her baby is doing, by saying, "You’re putting your pink spoon in your mouth.” or "Do you feel the rubbery handle on your spoon?” You can also encourage Mom to use positive words, such as, "A spoon works well to eat your soup.” It is not necessary for Mom to get her baby to use utensils properly; it’s all about trying. If she gives up and chooses to use her hands, that’s okay.

Some moms worry about offering their baby a fork. As long as the fork is plastic and someone is supervising, it is safe for a baby to use. Putting a piece of food on the end of the fork and leaving it on the baby’s plate or highchair tray might help her prepare to pick up the fork and try using it. Encourage Mom to offer her baby positive feedback, such as, "I like how you are holding your fork. You got your carrot in your mouth! Yum!”

Encouraging Positive Behaviour

<quotation>
"Use gentle hands when you touch the puppy."

<tagline>
Tell your baby what you want her to do, rather than what you do not want her to do.

<takeaway>
Your baby learns appropriate behaviour when she knows what is expected of her. 

<overview>
Think of a time someone told you, "Don’t look behind you.” What did you do? Many people immediately turn around and look. This is a common reaction when someone is told not to do something. It isn’t that they want to be difficult. It’s because they respond to the action words "look behind you,” rather than the directive word "don’t.” As a baby’s language develops, it can take time for her to understand what she hears. Positive explanations and directions help guide her through new situations. 

<practice>
Explain to Mom that when she guides her baby, it is often more effective to say what to do, instead of what not to do. If she says, "Don’t climb,” her baby may become confused. The active word "climb” stays in her head and it carries more meaning for her than "don't.” As a result, her baby might keep climbing even higher. When Mom uses positive directions—such as, "Come down”—her baby has a clear understanding of what she should do. Encourage Mom to focus on giving her baby appropriate alternative actions. Saying, "Touch softly” or "It’s your turn after your sister" will help Mom keep her baby focused on a specific action.

<takeaway>
Your baby gains independence as she learns how to take care of herself. 

<overview>
Babies benefit from participating in the tasks you do to take care of them. As a baby learns how to take care of some of her own needs, she starts to see herself as a capable person.

<practice>
Encourage Mom to be patient and give her baby time to practise doing things on her own. She can practise being independent by putting on her own socks or Mom can give her a butter knife so she can practise spreading jam on her toast. Clothes that are easy to put on and take off—such as slip-on shoes and clothes without buckles, zippers or buttons—will help her baby succeed. 

Talk to Mom about having the urge to "rescue” her baby when she is having trouble doing things on her own. Remind her that sometimes, giving a child a little more time allows her to get the job done. When her baby wants to get dressed by herself, Mom can lay out her pants in front of her and encourage her by saying, "Use your thumbs to hold your pants. Push your foot through. You did it! Now try your left foot.” Her baby will let her know when she needs help. Being patient will give her child time to try her best.

Suggest that Mom celebrate her baby’s accomplishment, rather than "fixing” it. This will help her baby feel a sense of pride in her success.

"What should we have for supper today?"

<tagline>
Provide your baby with a lot of healthy options to eat.

<takeaway>
Mealtimes are a chance to learn new things while having fun with healthy food. 

<overview>
Good nutrition is important for healthy brain development. It also gives a baby the energy she needs to play all day.

It is common for toddlers to want control over different aspects of their life. Eating is one thing that babies have complete control over, so it is common that they will assert their independence during mealtimes. Babies wake up in the morning after not having eaten for a long period of time. This is often the biggest meal a baby eats for the day. If parents/caregivers make sure that their baby is offered a big breakfast that has options from all the food groups, it is likely she will take in most of her calories in the morning. Often, this means dinner will probably be a smaller meal. Babies eat when they are hungry. When babies are forced to eat against their will, over time they become unaware of what their body is telling them they need. This leads to unhealthy eating habits in adulthood. It is best for a baby to be the one who decides if she is hungry or full.

Offering a baby many healthy options allows her to choose. But if a cookie is offered to her, she might become aware that this is an option and choose to eat it instead of the other options offered to her. 

<practice>
Suggest to Mom that her baby help prepare dinner. Find a space at the counter where she can stand on a chair and be at the same level as Mom. As Mom chops vegetables, she can let her baby try cutting something with a butter knife. Encourage Mom to talk to her baby about each ingredient in the meal and ask questions, like "What is this called?” "Where does it come from?” and "How much do you need?” She can offer her baby opportunities to try the ingredients individually or to smell and taste the spices she is using. With supervision, she can even help Mom stir the pot. When her baby takes part in cooking, she will feel a sense of ownership over the food and is more likely to taste it.

Tell Mom that her baby will be more willing to try new food if she becomes familiar with it. Giving her baby time to become familiar with new food and being understanding if she does not want to eat it is a good strategy. If her baby would like something else, maybe there is a banana she could have instead.

To avoid power struggles, Mom can offer her three or four different options on her baby’s plate. This will help her feel in control and she will be more likely to try at least one item. If she does not like her salad but loves her carrots, Mom can offer her more carrots.

"What do we need to do before we eat dinner?"

<tagline>
Questions about a baby’s everyday activities allow her to think about those routines.

<takeaway>
A baby feels secure when she knows what will happen during the day. 

<overview>
Daily routines make the day predictable. Babies learn the daily routines extremely well. When a parent/caregiver talks about the routine, a baby anticipates what will happen next. As she gets older, she will become ready to do parts of the routine herself. She might even start to initiate parts of the routine and predict what will come next.

<practice>
Help Mom get used to talking about the daily routine with her baby. Suggest to Mom that during consistent daily routines—such as bedtime—she can let her baby know what to expect next by saying, "First we will put on your pajamas, then we will brush your teeth and then it is time for bed.” As her baby gets older, Mom can ask questions about the routine. For example, "First we will put on your pajamas. What will we do next?” Ask Mom to try to be patient while waiting for her baby to answer. When answering questions, she is reviewing what she knows. This makes her feel confident and secure.

Giving Appropriate Choices

"Which book would you like to read?"

<tagline>
Offer your baby choices that you can accept.

<takeaway>
Trusting your baby to make simple choices builds her decision-making skills. 

<overview>
Part of independence is the ability to make decisions. Decision-making early in life prepares a baby to make good decisions throughout her life.

<practice>
Suggest to Mom that she start giving her baby simple everyday choices, such as, "What colour socks will you wear today?” Or, "What kind of cereal would you like for breakfast?” It may take a few minutes for her to decide or she might already know what she wants. Either way, she is practising making decisions for herself.

Remind Mom to offer authentic choices, not options that have a right and wrong answer. If Mom asks, "Do you want to wear your mittens?” when wearing mittens is essential, that is not a choice. Instead, offer a real choice: "It is cold outside. You will need to wear your mittens. Do you want your red mittens or your green ones?”

Choices are useful when a baby is asserting her independence. For example, if Mom is shopping and her baby decides to sit down in the store and not go any further, suggest that she offer real choices to her baby: "Would you like to sit in the cart and do your buckle up by yourself? Or do you want to help Mommy push the cart?”

Mom should support her baby’s choices when possible. For example, if her baby decides to do something else when someone is reading to her, the book can be set aside.

Managing Big Feelings

<quotation>
"You are frustrated that your toy fell down."

<tagline>
Help your baby learn to manage her emotions.

<takeaway>
Your baby’s emotions can be overwhelming. Parents/caregivers can help her learn appropriate coping strategies. 

<overview>
A baby feels complex emotions, such as pride, guilt and embarrassment. She is an active explorer who is determined to be in charge. This can result in frustration, anger and sadness when things do not go her way. She is also curious, eager to learn and excited to experience the wonder and joy of new adventures every day.

<practice>
Encourage Mom to talk to her baby about emotions and name them by saying, for example, "That made you really mad.” Her baby will learn how to identify her emotions and soon she will be able to describe what she is feeling. "That makes me mad!” Mom can accept and acknowledge her baby's feelings as valid while preventing harmful behavior by saying, "You are angry that Johnny took your ball, but you can’t hit him. Tell him you want the ball back.”

Suggest to Mom that she pay attention to potential triggers and try to plan ahead. For example, if her baby is more likely to be frustrated if she is hungry or tired, Mom can choose to go shopping after lunch and a nap. If her baby is attached to a particular toy, it might be useful to have it nearby so she can be comforted by it. If her baby is frightened by loud noises, Mom can warn her before using the blender or vacuum.

There will be times when Mom has to take charge, even if it means her baby will become upset. Mom can set clear limits and follow through, by saying, for example, "You must hold my hand when we cross the street or I will have to carry you.” A baby learns to manage frustration and anger when she has a calm, kind adult to help her organize her feelings. Mom can acknowledge that by saying, "I know that makes you mad; you wanted to do it by yourself. Now that we have crossed the road, you can walk by yourself again.”

"When little people are overwhelmed by big emotions, it is our job to share our calm, not to join their chaos.” L.R. Knost

Mine! "Yes, this is your book."

<tagline>
Recognise that as your baby grows, she becomes possessive of things she likes.

<takeaway>
Your baby’s sense of self grows when she understands that things can belong to her. 

<overview>
When a child is learning how to be an independent person who is in control of her own life, one of the clearest ways to take control is to claim ownership of something. She will firmly state, "Mine!” when she sees a toy, a book, a person or any other object she likes. A child wants to have power over her life and possessions and wants to make sure everyone knows she is in charge.

Parents/caregivers may want their baby to take turns and share. Sharing is voluntary and occurs when a baby willingly gives her toy to someone else. When a baby is forced to give up a toy or object, she loses her sense of control over the situation and is less willing to share the next time.

Encourage Mom to help her baby share items by pointing out the many ways that others take turns with her, such as saying, "I turned the page, now it is your turn to turn the page.” "That bag is heavy for you. Do you want me to take a turn carrying it?” "Would you like a turn stirring the cookie dough?” "Your brother finished brushing his teeth, now it is your turn.”

Mom can give positive feedback when her baby shares, like saying, "Thank you! You shared the plate of crackers; that was so kind!” Or, "You took a turn sweeping the floor. That was very helpful.” 

Encourage Mom to respect her baby’s decision when she doesn’t want to share, particularly when it involves something very special to her. "Yes, that is your bedtime blanket. You don’t have to share it with anyone.” Mom can allow her baby to decide when she is ready to share. If she is busy playing with a toy, for example, she will be less willing to share it. Remind Mom that a baby wants to be in control; she will be much more likely to give her toy up if she can do it on her own terms. "Bobby wants to play with those blocks. When you are done, please give him a turn.”

"Your diaper is still dry. Would you like to try the potty?”

<tagline>
Look for signs that your baby is getting ready to potty train.

<takeaway>
Potty training is gradual and is a significant milestone in your baby’s journey to independence. 

<overview>
By 24 months, a baby will likely start to show interest in potty training; that interest might come and go over the next few months, or longer. How adults respond to baby’s interest has an impact on how successful the process will be. To be fully potty trained, a baby must recognise the sensation of needing to go, get to the bathroom on time, remove all necessary clothing and get on and off the toilet by herself. It is also very helpful when a baby has enough language to communicate her needs.

It takes a long time for a baby to master all of the steps. She needs patience and encouragement from her parents/caregivers. When everyone has a positive approach toward potty training, a baby develops confidence in her ability to take care of herself.

<practice>
Mom may want to know what signs to watch for that indicate her baby might be ready to start potty training. One of the first signs might be curiosity about the toilet. Her baby might want to sit on the potty and may have a number of successes early in the process. She also might start to notice when her diaper is soiled, when she is "going” in her diaper and know the difference between being wet and dry. Parents/caregivers can ask their baby to try the potty regularly throughout the day so she becomes familiar with the routine. These times may include before bed, as soon as she wakes up, right after meals or before leaving the house.

Mom can decide whether to use pull-ups or underwear for her baby and when she will wear them. She might decide to continue to use diapers and pull-ups for outings and bedtime but use underwear for around the house. Finding a plan that works for her baby and making sure to maintain consistency so she understands the expectations will help her succeed.

Accidents will happen; they are part of the learning process. Encourage Mom to stay positive throughout this time so that her baby does not lose confidence in her ability to accomplish this difficult task. A simple response to an accident might be, "Oops, you are wet. Let’s go get some dry clothes on. Next time, let me know so we can get to the bathroom quickly.” This helps baby become more and more independent and confident.

What was the last big goal that you achieved? 
How did it make you feel to achieve it?
In what other ways can you empathize with your baby while she is learning this new task? 
How do you react when your baby has accidents?
How can you ensure that she feels positive throughout the process?
