<tagline>
Point out the letter’s in a child’s name when you see them in everyday life. 

<takeaway>
Using a child’s name is a good way to introduce letters of the alphabet. 

<overview>
Children’s names are a great tool for teaching letters of the alphabet. Children absorb more when they learn about something that is meaningful to them. Using “joint attention” is a way to make reading and writing engaging and special for children. Words in their environment can help children recognise the letters in their name. 

<practice>
<in the home>
Ask the parent/caregiver to focus on one letter in their child’s name. It can be the first letter or any other letter that is easy to identify. For example, “s” is an easy letter to learn because it doesn’t look like any other letter. Encourage the parent/caregiver to begin by pointing to and saying the name of the letter they have chosen. Explain to the parent/caregiver that looking at something together with their child in this way is known as “joint attention.” Encourage the parent/caregiver to show their child how to trace the letter with her finger—this can be done in the air or on a surface—then, name the letter by saying it out loud together. Eventually, they can bring their child’s attention to written words in her surroundings and have her identify the letter by saying, “Stella, I see an “s” on this sign. Can you find it?” 

<in the centre>
In a setting where you are dealing with numerous children’s names, using matching activities is a great way to engage children and encourage letter recognition. You can use common centre materials such as playdough, clothes pins, art supplies and books, to create activities where children match scattered letters to the letters in their name. One way of doing this is to use letter cut-outs or stickers. Write each child’s name on a surface and have them match each cut-out or sticker to the corresponding letter in their name. You can help children name, describe and trace the letters. Another way to encourage letter recognition in their names is to turn it into a game where you hide letters around the room and the children have to find a letter in their name in a Letter Scavenger Hunt. Or if children are learning about water, you can have them find letters or name rocks in an aquatic sensory bin. Make sure to label each child’s locker and personal items so they associate their own name as belonging to them. When the children complete artwork, help them sign their names, engaging them in the process. 

<reflection>
Which letters in the child’s name are easy to identify? 
Are there written words in the home, centre community that the child sees often? 
Are there written words in the home or the community that are important to the child? 
Where do you see letters from the child’s name in your community?

“I love reading this book to you every night.”

<tagline>
Find a book that a child loves to read, and read it often. 

<takeaway>
Reading books to the child that he is interested in encourages positive feelings about reading. 

<overview>
Parents/caregivers should follow a child’s lead to identify books he might be interested in. Children learn through repetition. When they choose the same book over and over again, they gain a feeling of mastery over the book, which boosts their confidence in reading. Preschool-aged children aren’t quite ready to learn to read on their own, but the more that a parent/caregiver reads to them, the more they will develop an interest in books. An early love of reading will help them excel when they learn to read and when they enter school. 

<practice>
<in the home>
Explain to parents/caregivers that responding positively to their child’s book preferences helps encourage him to have positive feelings about reading. They can take note of the parts of a book he loves and talk about it. For example, if he loves the dogs in an illustration, they can point out specific details in the image, such as the dog’s tail. Encourage parents/caregivers to ask questions such as, “Can you touch the dog’s tail?” Or, they can touch the dog’s tail and ask, “What part of the dog is this?” 
 
Explain that their child will want to return to familiar books, in part because he can predict what will happen next. This instills comfort and confidence in him. As their child becomes more familiar with a book, he will pretend to “read” it, reciting the words of the pages he has memorized.  

<in the centre>
Choose books that reflect the children’s interests and align with the activities going on in the centre or community. You can use a flip chart or whiteboard to create a topic web to visually organize the children’s understandings and questions about a topic. You can use the web as a guide in choosing books and designing activities to support learning more about the topic, or you can later place a photo of the web alongside any relevant documentation to demonstrate how centre activities were guided by the children’s current knowledge and interests. For example, if you are creating a web about transportation, and the children are talking a lot about trains, you can introduce a new book about trains to complement both the lesson and the children’s interests. If the class is learning about raising butterflies, you can choose the book The Very Hungry Caterpillar to learn how caterpillars become butterflies. 
 
You can also let the children choose which book to read. After reading a book with them, talk about it together. This helps to engage the children, strengthen literacy skills and promote an interest in reading. Some children might go on to “read” a book themselves or may “read” a book to others, demonstrating their growing confidence in their abilities. Balance reading to the group and finding time to read in small groups of one or two children at a time. 

<reflection>
What was your favourite book growing up? Who read it with you? 
What about the child’s favourite book grabs his attention the most? 
What questions can you ask as you read the book to help a child think about something new? 
How can you make the book new and exciting each time? 
What parts of the book can you relate to your child’s everyday life and to what he might be learning in the centre?

<quotation>
“What do you think our new house will be like? Let’s draw it.”

<tagline>
Provide a child with crayons and paper and talk about what she draws. 

<takeaway>
Through drawing, children learn the importance of documenting their thoughts. 

<overview>
Drawing teaches children that they can communicate on paper, fostering early writing skills. By drawing, children learn to document their thoughts even before they can write. This teaches children that paper can be a meaningful way to communicate. This concept is foundational to both reading and writing. 

<practice>
<in the home>
Encourage parents/caregivers to support their child’s early literacy by providing her with the time and necessary materials to draw and then engaging with her drawings in a meaningful way. Turning the child’s work into a conversation demonstrates that drawing offers a way to communicate. A child can be encouraged to draw a specific idea or object; this will show her that art can be used to communicate with intention.  
 
Tell parents/caregivers that it’s a good idea to praise whatever their child creates, commenting on the lines, placement, shapes or colours she uses. They can ask her questions about her work, such as, “Can you tell me more about your picture?” or “This must be you. Who is this standing beside you?” By admiring her work and considering it with her, they are “reading” what she has drawn, demonstrating the power of reading and writing. 

<in the centre>
You can support children’s early literacy skills by keeping a fully stocked art centre, providing dedicated time for art and engaging with the children’s drawings. As children are drawing, talk with them about their picture. You can comment on the lines, shapes, placement or colours. If you ask the children questions, such as “Can you tell me more about your picture?” or “Can you tell me who is in your picture?” you can write down their answers beside their drawings.   
 
It’s a good idea to add drawings and descriptions as documentation on the walls of the centre. This demonstrates to children that drawing is a way to communicate, and shows them how pictures can be connected to text. Adding text to the wall about how the art activity supports the curriculum is a way to engage parents/caregivers in their child’s learning, giving them the opportunity to continue the conversation about their child’s art at home. 

<reflection>
What kind of art do you like? What do you like about it? 
Do you know any artists in your own community?  
Do you have any art in your home or in the centre? 
How can you share more art with children? 
What kinds of questions can you ask a child to encourage her to think and talk about her artwork?

“I see something that is … blue!”

<tagline>
Describe an item you can see and encourage your child to find it. 

<takeaway>
Through games, parents/caregivers can model ways to communicate with words and sentences. 

<overview>
A child’s “receptive language,” meaning his ability to understand, develops more quickly than his ability to express thoughts. A game can be a good way to start communicating about objects that he might not be able to talk about yet. The I Spy game gives parents/caregivers the opportunity to label words for children and to model describing objects. 

<practice>
<in the home>
Talk to parents/caregivers about playing I Spy. It can be played while waiting in line at the store, in the car or during meals. The game begins when a parent/caregiver starts a sentence with, “I spy with my little eye something that is …,” and it ends with a word that describes an object the parent/caregiver sees. That word can be a colour, shape, texture or a way that the object is used. For example, “I spy with my little eye something that is red [or cold, or round].”  
 
Encourage parents/caregivers to give their child time to spot the object. If he has trouble, they can help him by pointing, labelling and describing the item. For clues, parents/caregivers can choose adjectives (descriptive words) that their child already knows, such as “soft.” Building up to more difficult concepts, they can say, “I spy with my little eye something that is a circle” or “I spy with my little eye something we use to eat.” The child can also take a turn to spy something for parent/caregiver to find. This will give him an interesting way to describe the world around him, allowing his parents/caregivers to observe. 

<in the centre>
I Spy is a game you can play with children to help them learn to label objects in the world around them, and to model how to properly use these words in a sentence. I Spy can be played with objects in the centre, on field trips or during playtime outside. With younger children, the game can begin with simple descriptors. For example, if children are busy building towers with colourful blocks, you could complement the activity with a game of I Spy: “I spy with my little eye, something that is yellow [or square].” 
 
The game can grow to include items or concepts that the children are learning about in the centre. For example, if they are learning the alphabet and letter sounds, you can say, “I spy with my little eye, something that starts with the letter ‘B’ and has a ‘buh’ sound.” If they are learning about camping and your dramatic play centre is set up as a campsite, you can say, “I spy with my little eye something that is used to start a campfire” or “something that is bumpy” when referring to the bark on a log. Once the children are familiar with the game, they can take a turn to spy something for caregivers or their friends to find, allowing them to practise observing the world around them, labelling their observations and expressing their thoughts.

Pretending to Read and Write

LANGUAGE MATTERS | 5

<title>

<quotation>
“That looks like a long list you made.”

<tagline>
Provide the child with books, paper and drawing tools that she can use in her pretend play. 

<takeaway>
Pretending to read and write builds a child’s confidence in her literacy skills. 

<overview>
At the preschool age, children develop language skills quickly and they become more imaginative in their play. Pretend play allows children to experiment with language and ideas. Pretending to read and write allows them to feel autonomous and grow confident in their literacy skills. Giving children both the time and the materials to explore the value of reading and writing gives them the chance to do it on their own playful terms. Dedicated art time, a well-stocked art station and creative free time allow children to explore their developing literacy skills. 
 
Children may mimic the behaviour of the adults in their lives, so they may pretend to write notes and grocery lists. Their writing may begin as lines or squiggles, then grow to become invented letters before beginning to resemble actual letters. It is important to encourage writing at every stage, as children who feel supported when writing squiggles or invented letters will feel encouraged to continue developing their writing abilities. 

<practice>
<in the home>
You can talk to parents/caregivers about setting up an environment to support their child’s literacy development. Explain to parents/caregivers that they can support pretend play for literacy by providing reading and writing materials and uninterrupted playtime. Having a neat and inviting space stocked with materials including newspapers, flyers, cardboard and sketch pads will ensure she has the items she needs to pretend to read and write. Offering writing materials that no longer work or washable markers and pens will allow her to pretend, and parents/caregivers can keep messier supplies for supervised play.  
 
Explain that she will benefit most if her play is self-directed, so she needs to be given the space to lead the playtime. She may mimic adult behaviour by pretending to choose items out of flyers and magazines or by pretending to write notes and shopping lists. She may draw long horizontal or wiggly lines to represent long lines of text, or circle to represents the shapes of letters.  

<in the centre>
The centre is a prime location for literacy development, as the environment is set up to support children’s creative activities. You can provide materials such as markers, crayons, pencils, paint, paper, cardboard, notepads and blank books to encourage children to practise reading and writing in many different ways. They can use these materials during structured art time or during unstructured play time, to pretend and practise their literacy skills when they want to. You can embed activities throughout the day that encourage reading and writing practice. Activities can include having a sign-in station where children write their names when they arrive at the centre, making a list or web where they sign their name when they share an idea, or playing restaurant where they pretend to write down one another’s orders. It does not matter if they use actual letters or squiggles; the idea is to get them excited and involved in pretending and practising to read and write.  

<reflection>
Do you remember pretending to read or write as a child? 
What are some interesting materials that can be used to pretend to read and write with? 
Have you ever seen the child “read” a book to a baby doll, younger sibling, or friend? 
How does the child pretend play? How could you incorporate writing into that play?

“What pictures are you going to draw?”

<tagline>
Help a child create a book of his own. 

<takeaway>
By describing the parts of a book while reading, parents/caregivers can teach children where to find information in books.  

<overview>
Learning how and where to find information is an important part of literacy. Labelling the parts of a book for children helps them understand how to navigate and derive information from books on their own. This, in turn, helps prepare them to be independent learners when they start school.  

<practice>
<in the home>
Encourage parents/caregivers to label and describe the parts of a book as they read together with their child. They can discuss with their child how each part of the book is important and provides useful information. Explain that the cover of the book includes information, such as the title, the author, the illustrator and a picture that shows what the book is about. The spine will include the title and author to let someone find the book when it’s on a bookshelf. The back cover will include the synopsis, or what the book is about, and the pages will have the story written and drawn on them. Parents/caregivers can ask questions to encourage their child to think about where to find information if he has questions. For example, they could ask, "If you wanted to find a book about horses, where would you look to find out if the book was about a horse?” 

<in the centre>
You can set out an invitation for children to create their own books. This allows them to become familiar with the different parts of a book and encourages their emerging literacy skills. Creating their own book will help them learn to navigate reading a book to find information.  
 
You can set out paper, tape, markers and other art supplies so each child can assemble and design their own book. Encourage them to come up with a name for their book, and ask them what they want to put on the pages. When everyone is finished, the books can be added to the reading area for all the children to read, or you can ask if anyone would like to share their book with the class.

How can you encourage children to use books to find answers?

“Yes, that’s a truck; this one is called a tractor.” 

<tagline>
Teach a child new words and use them often. 

<takeaway>
The more words children hear, the more words they learn.  

<overview>
Children benefit from being introduced to new words. The variety of words children hear and the frequency at which they hear them are important. The more times a child hears a word, the more likely she will remember the word. The richness of the vocabulary that children develop in the early years can affect their literacy skills and school success later on.  
 
Most of the words that children know in early childhood are learned from their parents/caregivers. Parents/ caregivers are in the best position to support language learning because they know what words their child already knows, can say and understand. There are no words—in Indigenous languages or in English—that are too big or too complicated to share with a child.  

<practice>
<in the home>
Suggest that parents/caregivers broaden their child’s vocabulary by sharing words and meanings with her that she does not already know. She is more likely to remember words that are related to her interests and her environment. Encourage caregivers to look for times when their child becomes interested in something that she does not yet have the language for, then talk about it. As she learns more about how and when to use a word, she is more likely to try using it. When she finds a rock, for instance, the parent/caregiver can say, “That’s a nice rock you found. I love it’s oval shape.” 
 
Encourage parents/caregivers to pronounce new words with their child and give her frequent positive feedback. As she learns to pronounce new words, she can be reminded of words she recently learned. The more confidence she develops in her language abilities, the more willing she will be to learn new words. 

<in the centre>
Children are exposed to many words while at the centre from talking with educators and friends.  By paying attention to what the children are interested in, you can use the information to curate a vocabulary-enriching environment. 
 
Labelling items throughout the centre and narrating children’s play will help the children to put words to their activities. If a child hands you a flower, saying “flower” you can say, “Thank you for the dandelion” to encourage vocabulary building. If the class is discussing caterpillars, you can show them pictures of cocoons, explaining what the word means. It takes repetition and time for children to begin to use a word, so while they might not use the word right away, exposing them to new words will help them build a strong vocabulary. 

<reflection>
What is the child interested in? What words can you teach her about this interest? 
What words does the child already know? How can you expand on what she already knows? 
What is your child curious about and how can you introduce her to related words?

“Those are the northern lights”

<tagline>
Teach the child words in more than one language. 

<takeaway>
Learning more than one language at the same time is beneficial to a child’s development. 

<overview>
Children who learn more than one language in the early years, particularly before age 3, have better cognitive, social and emotional abilities than their peers who speak a single language. Children who are introduced to more than one language at a young age are more likely to use both languages in their daily lives. Speaking more than one language connects children to more than one culture and gives them a more complex and empathic view of the world. This helps them to discover their place in the world.  

< practice>
<in the home>
Explain to parents/caregivers that children are more motivated to learn a new language when it is fun. Songs are a great way to teach a child a new language. Parents/caregivers can find songs that use simple words and are repetitive and rhythmic. Through songs, they can teach their child to become familiar with the sounds of the language even if his pronunciation is not perfect. Songs about body parts are great for this purpose; they provide visual cues that a child can point to as he learns new words.  
 
Command words, followed by movement, help the body assist in remembering the word. Commands like “Come here,” “Sit down,” or “Wake up” will tap into muscle memory. Suggest that parents/caregivers use commands from another language to engage their child’s body in his language learning. If the child does not understand a word right away, they can use hand gestures or model the action the words are commanding. Explain that the more their child uses his senses as he learns, the more likely he will remember new words.  

<in the centre>
You can incorporate simple songs and nursery rhymes into music and movement periods; adding songs with movements supports both a child’s language learning as well as the development of gross motor skills, which will strengthen the association between the movements and the language. Reading picture books that introduce another language helps children to connect the words being spoken to the picture on the page.  
 
By labelling objects around the centre in multiple languages, you can help children to create associations between the object and the world around them. When you speak to a child, you can repeat what you say in a second language to familiarize the child with that language. The more association a child has with other languages, the more comfortable he will be when using those words.

“The dad in this story looks like he’s making supper. What do you think he will do next?”

<tagline>
Pause when you read to a child to help her think about what might happen next in the story. 

<takeaway>
Thinking about what happens next in a story helps children understand storylines. 

<overview>
Children often sit passively as they are read stories. Engaging them in the process is important; asking questions helps them understand stories and storylines. For example, asking children about the order of events in a story helps them understand how events are sequenced in real life.  

< practice>
<in the home>
Ask parents/caregivers to choose a book with a storyline—not just a picture and a word or two on each page. Choose a book related to something of interest to her and something she already knows about. It can be about a new baby or an activity she does with her parent/caregiver, such as going to the grocery store. Suggest that parents/caregivers start by talking to their child about how the book relates to real life. This will help her understand how a storyline reflects the sequence of real-life events. 
 
Parents/caregivers can try stopping somewhere in the middle of the book before turning the page and ask, “What do you think is going to happen next?” They can give their child hints by reminding her of what has already happened. “The little boy put on his boots and jacket. What do you think he will do next?” She may need time to think about her answer. Show enthusiasm for any answer she gives. She is showing strength and courage by responding to a question she might not have the answer to; there is fun in guessing!  

<in the centre>
You can choose books with interesting storylines that relate to something that interests the children or to what they are learning at the centre. Involve children when reading books by talking to them and asking them questions about the book. After finishing a book, you can talk about other ways the book could have ended. If you are reading Alligator Baby, for example, you can talk about the different kind of animals the family brought home from the zoo, and ask the children if they know any other animals the family could have brought home. After some time has passed, you can ask the children to remember the story. As a group, try to construct, with words on a flipchart or photos of baby animals, what happened in the book, in the right order. You can ask them questions such as, “What was the first baby animal the family brought home from the zoo?” and “Who went back to the zoo and brought home the baby brother?” 
 
Talking about what happens next in a book can help to enhance children’s imagination and storytelling capabilities by connecting it to the process of beginning, middle and end in crafting a story. An activity to support children learning about “what happens next” and sequencing in a story could be reading a story with distinct parts that the children can remember, and prompting them to create art illustrating the parts of a book. For example, after reading The Three Little Pigs, you can ask children to decorate each house from the story asking them to remember the first, second and third houses.  

<reflection>
What are some books that have a clear beginning, middle and end?  
Is your child familiar with these already? 
Do you know any oral stories you can tell your child? Which ones?

“What did you like about that book?”

<tagline>
Ask your child questions about a book you have read together. 

<takeaway>
Reflecting on books with children encourages them to articulate their thoughts and preferences. 

<overview>
Asking children about books encourages them to think critically and to express their opinions. Validating how they interpret and relate to books allows children to develop confidence and a desire to read more. Children learn the value of reading and expressing opinions by talking about the books they have read.  

< practice>
<in the home>
Encourage parents/caregivers to discuss a book with their child while reading with him. Reflecting on a book together encourages him to talk through what he thinks with someone he loves and trusts. This activity encourages dialogue and sends a strong message about the importance of communication. Explain that when a parent/caregiver asks their child how he feels or thinks about something, he learns that his opinions matter. 
 
Parents/caregivers can ask their child open-ended questions that require more than a yes or no answer. These questions can begin with who, what, where, why or how. Close-ended questions have a right and wrong answer, but open-ended questions call for a child to express his own unique thoughts and opinions. If their child found the book was really exciting, they might ask him, “What made that book so exciting?” or “What did you like about that book?” Other questions might be, “What was your favourite part of the book?” and “Who was your favourite character?” He may need some time to think about his answers, so parents/caregivers can share their own thoughts as an example: “I loved the cat in the story. Who did you like best?”  

<in the centre>
You can help children reflect on books in many ways. During art time, you may want to do an activity asking children to reflect about a book creatively, perhaps by drawing their favourite character or a scene they enjoyed. If the book was exciting, you can ask children to act out their favourite parts. You can help children begin by telling them what you thought of the book. Listening to the children’s reflections can help you choose books in the future that align with what the children expressed, showing them that you consider their feedback and believe their thoughts are meaningful. 

<reflection>
Why is it important to listen to a child’s opinions? 
How can you show a child that you are listening? 
How can you ask a question that requires more than a yes or no answer?

Which Word Doesn’t Belong

“Apple, orange, banana, chair. Which word doesn’t fit in?”

<tagline>
Help a child think about how words do or don’t belong together. 

<takeaway>
When children consider the meaning of words in relation to each other, they learn more about what each word means. 

<overview>
As children develop, they engage with words and language in new ways. They begin to make sense of concepts in relation to each other. When children encounter information they cannot classify from what they already know, they alter how they associate concepts or develop new meanings for them altogether. Through this process, the structure of their brain actually changes. This type of brain development can be encouraged by playing sorting games with children.  

< practice>
<in the home>
Talk to parents/caregivers about playing Which Word Doesn’t Belong? with their child. This will encourage her to categorize and to assign new meanings and associations to words she knows. To play, they can come up with two or three words that their child knows and understands and that can be grouped together, then add one word that is different. For example, the list might be “car, truck, bus, dog.” They can then ask, “Which word doesn’t belong with the others?”  
 
There are many different ways to play this game. One is with a rhyming sequence, such as “cat, mat, hat, flower.” The level of difficulty can be changed as the child’s associative skills develop. For an easier version of this game, parents/caregivers can start with just three words that their child knows well, such as “apple, orange, chair.” If this seems too difficult for her, she can be given hints about how these objects are used. For a more advanced version of this game, objects that are more similar can be listed, such as “apple, orange, lettuce.” 

<in the centre>
Using visual sorting activities is a great way to support children to categorize the words they already know and create associations between new words. You can do this by setting out pictures of one type of object, such as fruit, alongside a picture of a different type of object, such as a firetruck. Then you can ask the children to identify which picture doesn’t belong. If they struggle with the activity, you can work together, pointing out the differences between the items. 
 
You can then move on to playing Which Word Doesn’t Belong? without visuals, grouping related words the child already knows and adding a different, unrelated word. As the children improve you can ask them to choose related and unrelated words to ask their friends which word doesn’t belong.  

<reflection>
When in your day-to-day life do you group items together? How do you know they are grouped together? 
What are some words the child knows the meaning of? What are some words that are relevant to her life? 
When in the day is a good time to play this game?

Talk about past experiences and teach children how to talk about them too.

<takeaway>
Asking a child questions about past experiences supports his language development.  

<overview>
Asking children about past experiences encourages language development and is a great way to teach past tense. Once children are able to correctly label actions in the present tense, they can begin learning the past tense. Parents/caregivers might need to model the appropriate use of the past tense and use cues to help children along the way, but with practice and conversation, children learn the correct language.  

This conversation can happen simply by asking open-ended questions about past experiences. Open-ended questions require more than a yes or no answer. They can begin with who, what, where, why or how. Close-ended questions have a right or wrong answer, while open-ended questions call for a child to express his own unique thoughts and opinions. If a child is having difficulty answering in the proper tense, parents/caregivers can gently correct him and model appropriate use.

<practice>
<in the home>
Encourage parents/caregivers to start a conversation with their child using pictures or objects to remember a past experience. They can describe the events related to the pictures or objects, then ask their child to describe another aspect of what happened. The questions can be about a big exciting event, like going to a celebration, or about something small, like walking to the store. The questions can be about an event that happened last week or yesterday. If their child responds to the questions using the present tense, explain that past events should be described using the past tense. Model the correct use of words. For example, if parents/caregivers ask, “What happened at the celebration?” and their child responds, “Dance!” parents/caregivers can then say, “Yes! We danced.”  

<in the centre>
Conversations about past and present tense can happen naturally as you talk with the children throughout the day. You can ask children, “What did you do over the weekend?” or “What did you do outside?” Or you can ask about an event that happened at the centre, such as a past field trip. You might also want to explore memories that are documented on the classroom wall by asking children to recall a past event and communicate what happened.   
 
This activity highlights why it’s important to document and display the activities children do and the experiences they have. For example, if you recently went on a walk to the park, you can ask the children to help you tell the story of what happened and decide where the pictures you took should go. You can encourage them by asking questions about what they remember, using the photos as a prompt. You can ask, “What did we do first at the park?” and a child may answer, “We runned around and played tag!” and you can say, “That’s right! We ran around and played tag,” hanging that photo on the wall. Asking the children to recall the event as a group allows you to create a visual story of the trip while modelling the proper use of past and present tense. A child might respond, “Climb tree!” when asked what they did outside, and you can say, “Yes, you climbed the tree!” to model how the word is appropriately used in the past tense. Over time, with continued conversations and modelling, the children will learn how to differentiate between the past and present tense. 

<reflection>
What big events happen in your home and community that are important to your family? How do they make you feel? Why? 
How do you prepare a child before such events? What do you talk about? 
How can you reflect on these exciting events with the child afterward?
