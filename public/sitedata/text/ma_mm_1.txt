"I can see you, Can you see me?"

<tagline>
Your face is your baby’s favourite place to look.

<takeaway>
At birth, your baby can only see so far. When she is nursing, her mother’s face is the perfect distance for her to focus on.

<overview>
A baby’s vision at birth is not completely developed. Her eyes must start to work together to bring things into focus. Newborns can detect human faces, but their vision is blurry. Babies explore their surroundings by scanning with their eyes.

<practice>
Explain to Mom that the best focal point for a newborn’s vision is about 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm) away, which is approximately the distance between Mom’s face and her breast. One of the first things a baby can see and learn to recognise is her Mom’s face. Encourage Mom to make as much direct eye contact as possible while her baby is breastfeeding.

<reflection>
Do you have a quiet place to breastfeed? 
How does it feel to look at your baby while you are feeding her?
How can you ensure your focus in on your baby during this special time? 
What can you say to your baby while breastfeeding?

"You found your toy!"

<tagline>
Move yourself or an object—a rattle, a ball or a soft toy—slowly back and forth in front of your baby.

<takeaway>
Your baby learns to follow movement with her eyes, ears and body. This strengthens her neck muscles and exercises her abilities to see and hear.

<overview>
A baby will follow moving objects at first with her eyes. Then she will start to turn her head.

<practice>
Explain to Mom that when her baby is about 6 months, she will be able to twist and turn her whole body to follow an object. She might be interested in watching objects that wiggle or move frequently, make noise, have colour contrasts or are black and white. Suggest to Mom that she  move her own body or an interesting object for her baby to follow when her baby is lying on her back and is fed, well rested and happy. By doing this several times a week, her baby will get exercise and practise her motor skills.

<reflection>
Where is a safe, comfortable place to play with your baby? 
Which toy does she love to look at?
How fast is the perfect pace to move the toy?

"Tansi ... I’m over here!"

<tagline>
Talk to your baby from a distance so she turns to look for you.

<takeaway>
Your baby is learning to listen and notice where sounds are coming from. 

<overview>
As a baby grows, she turns her gaze toward voices she is familiar with. She has started to realize that when she hears something, she can also see it. She will begin to understand that she can use several senses together to solve a problem.

<practice>
Suggest to Mom that she call out to her baby from behind or beside her, then watch and see if her baby turns toward her. As her baby grows, Mom can try this from different places around her baby’s body. This will challenge her problem-solving skills and encourage her to move her body in different ways.

<reflection>
Have you seen your baby look for your voice before? 
Has she done this when can she hear you but can't see you?
How does she respond when you come back into sight?
How do you celebrate the success of your baby looking in the right direction to find you?

Tummy Time

Meaningful Moments | 4

<title>

"Let’s play on the floor together."

<tagline>
Place your baby on her tummy on a mat or blanket. Sit or lie at her level and offer her toys.

<takeaway>
Tummy time allows your baby to exercise her muscles and discover new ways to move.

<overview>
Active babies are thinking babies. Tummy time encourages a 1- to 2-month-old baby to control her head by holding it up to look around. At 3 or 4 months, she will be able to push up with her forearms to get her chest off the floor.

<practice>
Explain to Mom that the best place for babies to try tummy time is on a mat or blanket set on the floor. If a baby has not tried tummy time before, suggest to Mom that she begin slowly, for very short periods of time. Remind her that her baby should have good head control before beginning tummy time. If she isn’t able to lift her head up and hold it steady, she is not ready.

To help her practise, Mom can get down on the floor and face her baby. Talking to her baby about what is happening, smiling and laughing will help her baby feel comfortable while she tries this new skill. Remind Mom to be sensitive to her baby’s cues that she has had enough.

Encourage Mom to notice her baby’s progress. At first, she might only want one or two minutes of tummy time. Later, she might enjoy it for ten minutes or more. Then, she will start to reach for a nearby toy and try to roll over. These little changes are signs that she is getting stronger.

<reflection>
How does your baby react to tummy time? 
How do you make sure to enjoy tummy time with your baby?
Are there times of the day when your baby enjoys tummy time and times when she doesn’t? 
What can you do to keep your baby interested during tummy time?

Reaching Up

Meaningful Moments | 5

<title>

<quotation>
"Can you touch the ball?"

<tagline>
Lie your baby on her back and hold brightly coloured toys or other objects over her chest and within her reach.

<takeaway>
Providing your baby with interesting objects develops her hand–eye coordination by encouraging her to use her arms deliberately.

<overview>
One of the first motor skills a baby develops with purpose is the ability to open and close her hands. Grasping things and turning them over is an important skill that contributes to a baby's cognitive development. Her mouth has many nerve endings, so after she grabs an object, watch as she brings it straight to her mouth so she can feel it.

<practice>
At about 3 or 4 months, most babies start to try to hold objects. Point out to Mom when her baby intently studies her own hands as she reaches up, turning items over and watching the movements. Explain that this is how a baby discovers she has the necessary eye, head and shoulder control to reach for items purposefully. Next, she will develop the ability to grasp, closing her fingers toward her palm. She will adjust her grasp to the size and shape of an object she is trying to hold.

By 4 to 6 months, Mom will notice that her baby has more control of her body movements. She will get better at reaching and grasping. This means she is ready to practise reaching and touching. Suggest to Mom that she play with her baby by holding a toy in different locations around her body and telling her that she is reaching "so high" or "so far."

<reflection>

"What’s that sound?"

<tagline>
Shake a rattle with a handle in front of your baby. Then hold it so your baby can grab the handle.

<takeaway>
Your baby learns from looking at, hearing, holding and putting her mouth on different objects. 

<overview>
A baby learns that her actions cause different outcomes. For example, every time she shakes a rattle, it makes a noise. 

<practice>
Suggest to Mom that she watch her baby become a curious explorer, trying out new actions and waiting to see a response. Babies love to be surprised. To practise, tell Mom to use a toy or something that cannot fit entirely in her baby’s mouth. Soft toys are the best way to start because the baby’s movements can be jerky; she could hit herself with a toy she is trying to put in her mouth. It is best to introduce one toy at a time so she can focus on it and explore it thoroughly. A small rattle with a handle is a good choice. Mom can call her baby’s attention to the noise the rattle makes by saying, "Did you hear the rattle? You can shake it to make noise!” She can also try a rubber ring, a soft doll or a board book with pictures.

"You are sitting up by yourself, look how strong you are getting."

<tagline>
Place pillows around your baby while she sits on her bum.

<takeaway>
Your baby needs your support to learn new skills and she needs a safe landing when she tips over. 

<overview>
Babies start to develop motor skills and large muscle groups a few months after they are born. Parents/caregivers can make sure the environment around the baby is safe to explore.

<practice>
At about 4 to 6 months, when a baby has good control of her head and neck, suggest to Mom that she provide support for her baby while she sits up for short periods of time. This builds the core muscles in her back and abdomen.

Mom can use a U-shaped nursing pillow as support for her baby or use pillows or blankets from around the house. Or, Mom can hold her baby in her lap, between her legs. Sitting up gives her baby a new perspective of the world around her. Remind Mom to never leave her baby alone if she cannot sit without support. Once a baby is able to sit on her own, encourage Mom to place toys around her so she can reach for them.

"Where did the bunny go ... squeak, squeak ... There she is!"

<tagline>
Show your baby a toy that makes noise, put it out of sight, make the noise and then let her see the toy again.

<takeaway>
Early on, your baby will start to learn a big idea—that objects exist even when they are out of sight. 

<overview>
At around 5 months, a baby starts to learn that things are still there even when they cannot be seen anymore. Hearing a sound that a toy makes when it is out of sight helps a baby understand that the toy still exists. Knowing that things and people continue to exist when they are out of sight helps her begin to understand how the world works.

<practice>
Explain to Mom that there are many ways to play with this experience, such as choosing an exciting toy and letting her baby watch her cover it with a light blanket. Then she can ask her baby, "Where did your dolly go?” This gives her baby the opportunity to solve a problem and use her memory to find the toy on her own. Mom might also do this during caregiving routines, such as at bath time, by hiding her baby’s toy duck over the side of the tub, squeaking the toy and asking, "Where’s your duck?” Next, she can wait for a response and then show her baby the duck.

<reflection>
What is your baby’s reaction when a toy goes out of sight?
Does she look for it? If she doesn’t look for it, how does she react when it makes a sound?
If you let her watch you cover the toy with a blanket, will she try to find it? 
How can you make this experience easier for your baby?
Once she gets the hang of it, how can you make it more difficult?

"Patty cake, patty cake."

<tagline>
Hold a small, safe object in front of your baby so she can grab it with both of her hands.

<takeaway>
Your baby learns to control her hand movements and to coordinate both sides of her body so she can use both of her hands at the same time.

<overview>
At about 5 or 6 months, a baby’s brain develops so she can begin to use both sides of her body. This gives her the ability to coordinate her hands to meet in the middle, bringing her hands together. Next, she will start crossing her hand over her body to use on the opposite side. As she further develops her physical skills, she will learn to coordinate her body movements to crawl and walk. 

<practice>
Encourage Mom to model her baby’s new physical abilities. Mom can bring her own hands together in front of her baby and sing a clapping song, like Pat-a-Cake.

<reflection>
What is something exciting—but safe—that you can encourage your baby to reach for in front of her body? 
If you clap your hands first, will she copy you?

"Pass the bear back to me, please."

<tagline>
Pass or roll an interesting object to your baby and encourage her to pass or roll it back to you. 

<takeaway>
When you and your baby pass objects back and forth, she is learning about taking turns. 

<overview> It can be difficult for a baby to learn to trust that the item she is giving away will be returned to her. She doesn’t know how to think ahead yet. 

<practice> Encourage Mom to pass objects back and forth to her baby. Taking turns with an object is like having a non-verbal conversation; it allows her baby to practise taking turns and mimics how a conversation works.

Remind Mom to be patient and flexible, allowing her baby to hand items back when she is ready and then showing excitement and smiling when her baby is successful. She can try thanking her baby for being so kind and sharing and then give the item back to her baby. This exercise builds a baby’s trust that she will have the item again and helps her start to understand delayed gratification.

<reflection> When your baby is playing, how does she interact with you? 
How do you interact with her?
Are there opportunities during bath time, mealtimes or other routines when you can practise handing an item back and forth?

<quotation>
"I see you reaching for your rattle ... use your feet to push yourself closer."

<tagline>
During tummy time, place an exciting toy slightly in front of your baby and encourage her to move toward it.

<takeaway>
Your baby will want to reach for the toy you put in front of her and will start to move toward it. 

<overview>
Developmental milestones, such as crawling, happen naturally for most babies. By paying attention to when a baby is ready, parents/caregivers can find opportunities to challenge her. 

<practice>
Suggest to Mom that she observe her baby closely so that she knows when her baby is ready to start crawling. Her baby will push up on her arms to lift up her chest, get up onto her toes or her knees and then start rocking back and forth. When her baby starts these actions, she is ready to start crawling. 

Mom can place a toy just slightly out of her baby’s reach and encourage her to move toward it. If her baby can’t get it and becomes frustrated, move it closer so she can reach it. Mom can try encouraging her baby to move toward a family member or pet.

"Peek-a-boo, I see you!"

<tagline>
Put your hands in front of your face and say, "Peek-a-boo.” Then remove your hands and smile at your baby. Repeat.

<takeaway>
Peek-a-boo games help your baby learn that a certain pattern of actions results in a certain response. 

<overview>
Peek-a-boo games are always fun and exciting because a baby loves to look at her parents/caregivers. This game helps her learn that when things are out of sight, they will come back again. This is called "object permanence,” and it helps her develop trust. This will help her in social situations later in life.

<practice>
Suggest a game of "peek-a-boo.” Mom can try covering her face and eyes while playing with her baby, then remove her hands and say "Peek-a-boo!" This helps her baby anticipate that her Mom’s face will reappear. Often, this game makes her squeal with delight. The activity can be extended with a towel or blanket over Mom’s face, which can then be removed or Mom can peek out from underneath it. Mom can lean toward her baby, so that her baby can try to pull the blanket off of her. This type of play teaches cause and effect.

"The itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout."

<tagline>
Sing songs with your baby that have hand or body movements in them.

<takeaway>
Songs and rhymes that have a repetitive action allow your baby to predict and anticipate what will come next. 

<overview>
Singing songs that have accompanying hand movements or other actions provides a baby with many ways to participate. She can sing the tune, move her hands, get up and dance or play an instrument. Songs are a fun way to practise language skills. Adding a pause so that she can fill in the blank word or sound will help her retrieve information from her memory and use it in a way that she sees as both useful and fun.

<practice>
Action songs are fun for Mom and her baby. Encourage Mom to pause when a specific movement is supposed to happen during a rhyme or song, to see if her baby is anticipating what should happen next. When her baby does respond, Mom can praise her with a smile or by clapping and continuing to sing the song. Explain to Mom that her baby can show that she knows things before she can even speak. In time, she will become more confident in communicating. Tell Mom that her baby loves to practise what she knows.

Singing songs together is a fun way to explore the rhythm and rhyme in everyday language. It’s an easy way to practise words and expressions. Mom can face her baby while she sings so her baby can see her mouth moving. She will mimic the shape her Mom’s mouth is making.

"You’re using your legs to jump up high."

<tagline>
Hold your baby facing you on your lap and let her use her legs to bounce. You can exaggerate how high she bounces to make her laugh.

<takeaway>
Your baby needs opportunities to build the large muscles in her legs, which she will later use to walk. 

<overview>
Babies love to bounce up and down and it strengthens the muscles in their legs and abdomen.

<practice>
Suggest to Mom that she can make bouncing even more fun for her baby by exaggerating the bounce that she makes on her lap. This will help her baby understand that actions have an effect. Over time, her baby will start to do the movement all on her own while Mom supports her for balance.

"Feel the beat of the drum."

<tagline>
Listen to music, hold your baby and move around to the beat.

<takeaway>
Your baby learns rhythm when she listens and moves to music. 

<overview>
Music introduces the rhythm and rhymes in everyday language. Listening to music helps a baby learn the sounds, or building blocks, of language and, eventually, reading. Rhythm is also a building block for math. Rhythm is made up of repetitive patterns and it sets the stage for a baby to start understanding patterns, sets and cycles.

Music is a great way to pass down tradition, stories and language. Making sure that a baby hears traditional music and introducing her to traditional dances at community events will help her learn about her culture.

<practice>
Encourage Mom to play music while holding her baby and dancing with her. By smiling and looking at her baby while she sings and dances, Mom can provide comfort when her baby is feeling fussy. Being held close and experiencing gentle movements is comforting to your baby. It not only makes her feel great, it is also a stress reliever for Mom.

<takeaway>
Your baby can imitate what you are doing and connect your words to your actions. 

<overview>
A baby’s most important teachers are her parents/caregivers. She absorbs and learns from everything they do.

<practice>
Encourage Mom to teach her baby to imitate simple movements and actions, such as waving, tapping with a spoon and clapping hands. While Mom is cooking, she can give a pot and wooden spoon to her baby. As Mom stirs her pot, she can say, "Stir, stir, stir,” and watch as her baby copies her actions. Imitation games continue to support emerging thinking skills and help build her baby’s vocabulary.

"Look at how strong you are ... you’re standing all by yourself."

<tagline>
Provide safe opportunities for your baby to use furniture or other objects to pull herself up to a standing position.

<takeaway>
When your baby can move safely and freely, her physical development will improve. 


<overview>
Babies become more and more mobile as they grow. When they are almost ready to walk, they pull themselves up and stand whenever they can. This prepares them for their next big milestone.

<practice>
Encourage Mom to make sure that her baby has a safe place to practise standing up. She can provide a step stool, ottoman, couch or other furniture that won’t tip over when her baby uses it to pull herself up. Once a baby can do this with ease, Mom can place a toy a few steps away and encourage her baby to move toward it.

Discuss safety with Mom. It is important she knows that her baby will try to pull herself up even if it is not safe. Ensure a safe and enjoyable activity by planning for it and having safe items around to use.

"The blocks can go in and out again!"

<tagline>
Encourage your baby to drop toys into a large container, such as a plastic bucket or shoebox and then dump them out.

<takeaway>
Your baby is learning how her actions can change things. 

<overview>
Babies enjoy dropping one object into another object and then dumping it out. They especially enjoy the dumping out part. Dropping and dumping helps a baby see that her actions affect the world around her. When a baby drops things and then dumps them, she is improving her ability to grasp and release objects. She is also building on her understanding of object permanence. Dropping and dumping is a form of exploration that allows a baby to test out concepts and make things happen. She is learning how her actions change things and she is starting to build problem-solving skills.

<practice>
Encourage Mom to find a container for her baby to drop objects—such as small stuffed toys or some blocks—into. Mom can show her baby the full bucket. Then she can dump the bucket out in front of her baby. Mom can count the objects as she puts them back into the bucket.

"First you step with your left foot, then your right foot."

<tagline>
Hold your baby’s hands as she uses her feet to move forward.

<takeaway>
Your baby needs you to help her feel confident in her abilities. She will learn that she can trust you to be there when she falls.

<overview>
Learning to walk is a big milestone in a baby’s development. Parents/caregivers must continually adjust the amount of support they offer their child as she grows. The key is finding a balance between keeping their baby interested and challenged and making sure she feels confident and successful.

<practice>
Encourage Mom to follow her baby’s lead, providing support while allowing her to develop skills at her own pace. Once her baby is comfortable holding up her own weight, Mom can stand her on the floor and hold her baby’s hands. Next, Mom can lean her baby slightly forward as her baby puts one foot in front of her to support her body weight. Eventually, Mom can offer less and less support until her baby can stand and take a step on her own. This is a good example of gradually letting a baby do things without help.

<reflection>
