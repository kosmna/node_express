<episode>Playful Talk<index>Language Matters | 1<title>bababadadabalamamalalala<tagline>Respond to your baby’s attempts to communicate.<takeaway>Your baby plays with language when she is learning to talk. <overview>When a baby is between 12 and 18 months of age, she will imitate the patterns of language she hears around her. It might sound like she is carrying on a conversation by stringing together nonsense words, mimicking the tone and rhythm of conversation, using eye contact, using gestures and sometimes putting an actual word in the mix. She might sound excited, angry, sad, happy or afraid, even if she is not actually experiencing these emotions. She is practicing sound patterns by paying attention to the characteristics of speech.<practice>Ask Mom about her baby’s use of playful talk. Explain that when her baby tries to talk, it’s a good opportunity to practise "serve and return.” When her baby uses playful talk, Mom can respond by trying to interpret what she is saying, taking cues from words or gestures she is using. For example, if her baby says, "Ooopa doopa doopa ball ooopa doopa,” while pointing toward the door, Mom could say, "Yes, your ball is outside. Do you want to go play with it?” Even if Mom doesn’t understand what her baby is saying, she can still respond with, "Oh, that’s so interesting,” "Really? Tell me more!” or "You sound mad. What happened?” Mom can even give her baby a toy telephone and have a playful conversation with her over the phone.<reflection>How does your baby communicate with you? What can you say to your baby when she is talking like this?<keywords>serve and return; language; social-emotional; conversations; 
<episode>Many Ways to Describe<index>Language Matters | 2<title>"Those purple petals on the flower are very soft."<tagline>Use many descriptive words when talking to a baby.<takeaway>When a parents/caregiver uses descriptive words, a child develops a more complete understanding of her environment. <overview>When parents/caregivers describe the things a child sees, hears or feels, it strengthens her understanding of her world. In time, she will describe her experiences on her own. Adding a little bit of extra information is a small task that has a big impact on a child’s developing vocabulary.<practice>Talk to Mom about how children use all five senses— sight, touch, sound, smell and taste—to absorb information. Mom can think about this when she describes items to her child. Casually mentioning colour, shape, size, scent, texture and numbers brings her awareness to these details.• "Those four wheels on your truck are so bumpy. Can you feel the bumpy tires?”• "You are colouring with an orange marker. It even smells like an orange.”• "Your soup is hot. See the steam coming up? Let’s blow on it.”• "Would you like a red cup or a green cup? You’d like the green cup.”<reflection>How does it feel to add more detail when you are speaking to your baby? Does your baby prefer certain colours or textures?How can this activity help encourage your baby’s appreciation of nature or her awareness of her environment?Are there words in your traditional language that better describe what she is experiencing?<keywords>describe; narration; Cree; language; expression; literacy; syllabic; writing; tradition; vocabulary; language; details; senses;
<episode>Making Marks on Paper<index>Language Matters | 3<title>"That is a very long line you made."<tagline>Encourage your baby to make marks on a large piece of paper. Talk to her about the marks she makes.<takeaway>Using crayons, markers and other writing tools is an early stage of literacy. <overview>First "drawings” will mostly be lines and curves. A baby begins by understanding that she can make marks on paper. Later she will see that the marks can represent an object or idea. At first, she will colour at random, but before long, her marks will have purpose. As your child becomes able to control her arms, hands and fingers, she will make deliberate marks.<practice>Ask Mom to offer her baby a blank piece of paper and a few crayons. Encourage her to talk to her child about the lines she draws and the colours she is using as they colour together. Using blank paper may be the best idea at this stage; her child is not yet ready to colour inside the lines of a colouring book.Talk to Mom about the different ways she can make marks, such as drawing with a stick in the sand, running a finger over frost or fog on a window or using pen and pencil on paper.Remind Mom that babies don’t always realize that drawings are for paper. They draw on walls, floors or other surfaces. Mom might want to remember to keep crayons, markers and paint out of her baby’s mouth. Mom can try saying, "Colour on the paper,” or "Crayons are for drawing, not eating.”<reflection>Does your baby see you making lists or using a pen and paper for other purposes? How can you gently bring your baby’s attention to this?Is there opportunity for her to write on your list as well? Has your baby shown an interest in colouring?What can you say if your baby colours on the walls or puts crayons in her mouth? What importance does art play in your culture?How can you make your baby aware of the lines and shapes in the art around her?<keywords>Art; language; self-esteem; creativity; gross; motor; development; fine; serve & return; back & forth; expression; emotion; caregiver-child; bond; expression; describe; narration; Cree; language; expression; literacy; syllabic; writing; tradition; vocabulary
<episode>One Word, Many Ideas<index>Language Matters | 4<title>"This is our car. Where is the car? Look at that fast car!"<tagline>Interpret what your baby is trying to say and expand on her ideas.<takeaway>Your baby may use one word for many purposes. Acknowledging her attempt to communicate gives her confidence to speak more.<overview>A baby will be encouraged to talk when she sees that people are responding to her efforts to communicate. A baby’s vocabulary grows when she is between 12 and 24 months of age. Because she has a limited number of words, she will often use one word to express a complete thought. "Car" might mean, "I am in the car," "Where is the car?" or "The car is fast!" She understands the different ways a single word can be used. <practice>Ask Mom to listen carefully to the words her baby uses and try to understand what she is saying. Mom might need to rely on her baby’s tone of voice, gestures and the situation to guess what her baby means. Repeating the word back to her and using it in a full sentence tells her that someone is trying to understand her. For example, if a baby says "car” and Mom understands it to mean "I am in the car”, she might respond, "Yes, we are in the car. We are going to granny’s house.” If a child is sitting with a cup of milk and smiles, then says, "milk,” she is probably saying she likes the milk. Mom can show her baby that she understands by saying, "Yes Takoda, you like your milk.” <reflection>What words does your baby use?When can you use the words your baby knows so that she hears them in different contexts? How can you expand her understanding of certain words?<keywords>Serve & return; communication; bond; connection; caregiver-child; receptive; expressive; language; joint attention; secure; attachment; expanding; validating; adult-child interactions;
<episode>Reframe, Repeat and Expand<index>Language Matters | 5<title>"Where my wabbit?” "Your rabbit is under the blanket."<tagline>If your baby mispronounces a word, repeat it back to her properly and in a sentence rather than correcting her.<takeaway>Your baby learns how to say words when she hears them in conversation. <overview>Learning to talk is a complex process. It requires control of the small muscles in the lips, tongue and throat. Talking also requires the ability to remember how and when to use sounds. As a baby uses more and more words, she will have her own versions of familiar words, particularly words that do not fit the regular rules of language. For example, a baby might say "mouses” instead of "mice.” Correct grammar and pronunciation take time and a lot of practise.<practice>Talk to Mom about using correct grammar and pronunciation when she talks to her baby and discuss how she can use "serve and return” to help her baby learn. To do this, Mom can listen to what her baby has to say, then model the grammatically correct way to use a word. Rather than correcting her baby directly, she can be positive and supportive. If Mom hears her baby say "mouses”, she can reply, "Yes, there are mice in this story.”<reflection>Have you ever tried to learn a new language? What were some of the challenges?What helped the process?Are there words your child mispronounces? How do you respond?<keywords>adult-child interactions; positive guidance; responding; language; 
<episode>Read the World Around You<index>Language Matters | 6<title>"That sign says ‘stop’."<tagline>Pointing out printed words in the environment helps your baby develop an awareness of letters and words.<takeaway>Your baby is learning that words and pictures have meaning. <overview>Early experiences with print contribute to later literacy. When parents/caregivers draw attention to words in a baby’s environment, they help her understand that printed words are everywhere and that these words and pictures are a source of information. When parents/caregivers point them out, a baby will start to look for words and pictures wherever she goes. She may start to ask what they mean as she continues to try to understand her world.<practice>Ask Mom to help her baby notice written words around her. Encourage Mom to read stop signs, store names, posters/billboards, food boxes, exit signs and any other words, pictures or text to her baby as she goes about her day. She can point out a familiar sign in the neighborhood or words written on her shirt. When the word and picture are together—such as a picture of strawberries on a strawberry yogurt container—Mom can point to the word and the picture to show they go together. Remember to keep this activity fun and follow the baby’s lead. Soon she will start pointing out signs herself, asking what they say.<reflection>What signs do you notice in your community? Does your baby have clothing with words on it?What words or pictures can you show your child in your home? Is your baby’s name on anything in your home?<keywords>literacy; language; environment; 
<episode>Two-Word Sentences<index>Language Matters | 7<title>"Milk gone. Yes, your milk is all gone. Would you like more?"<tagline>Repeat and expand your baby’s two-word sentences.<takeaway>Repeating and expanding your baby’s sentences will give her new ways to express ideas. <overview>A baby shows that she understands how language works when she starts combining words into sentences. First she will put two words together, then three and then four. With more words, she expresses more complex thoughts, recognizing that more words convey more meaning. She will probably use active words, like "Daddy walk,” to get her message across clearly, rather than full grammar, such as "Daddy is taking me for a walk.” Hearing someone else add detail to what she says helps her to gradually use more words.<practice>Talk to Mom about waiting patiently for her baby to find the words to express her ideas and then building on what she says. Mom can ask her baby questions that she can easily answer, then expand on what she says. This gives her baby the opportunity to put words together and hear them repeated in new ways.If Mom asks her baby, "Do you want the pink blanket?” her baby might respond, "Pink blanket.” Mom can then build on that by saying, "Okay, here is your pink blanket. It is warm and fuzzy.”<reflection>Is your baby starting to use two or more words at a time? What are some words she is comfortable using?What words do you know in your traditional language that you can share with your baby?<keywords>adult-child interactions; positive guidance; responding; language; communication
<episode>Pointing in Books<index>Language Matters | 8<title>"You’re touching the puppy’s tail. Can you touch the puppy’s nose?"<tagline>Take turns pointing to items in a book and naming them.<takeaway>When you pay attention to an item at the same time as your baby, your baby can absorb a larger amount of information.<overview>Reading with a baby is a positive and enjoyable experience. When parents/caregivers offer a baby the opportunity to participate when reading a book, she learns a lot. Having an adult tell her the names of items she doesn’t know while asking questions so she can share what she already knows makes her feel confident and allows her to build on her skills.The more words a baby understands (her receptive vocabulary), the more words she will use (her expressive vocabulary). This improves her language skills. Strong language skills will improve her ability to get along with other children, enjoy herself and do better in school. Although she might not be interacting with other children and adults yet, learning these skills in her early years will help her do better later in life.<practice>When Mom has been reading out loud to her baby for some time and pointing out words to read out in the world, she is helping her baby build literacy skills. To build on this, ask Mom to be more interactive with her baby while reading books and other printed materials and continue to build enthusiasm about books and literacy.Talk to Mom about choosing books for her baby that are exciting and relate to her baby’s daily life. Explain to Mom that when she shows enthusiasm while reading, her baby will feel excited to be involved. Mom can build excitement about books by pointing out pictures and asking questions with curiosity and enthusiasm. "Here is an eagle on this page. Can you touch the eagle too?” Tell Mom it is helpful to show excitement and give positive feedback when her baby responds. This will encourage her to continue participating.After reading a book, Mom can remind her baby—later in the day—what they read by asking a related question, such as, "Can you show me something the baby needs when she goes to bed?”<reflection>When is a good time for you to point out and talk about items in the real world that you’ve read about in books? Are there particular items that your baby is interested in?When are there opportunities to talk about them? How can you further your baby’s understanding of those items? <keywords>Toddler; reading; age-appropriate; picture; book; problem solving; language; fine; motor; development; repitition; story; telling; interactive;  talk; sing; pages; personal; story; routine; books; learning; see; show; say; early literacy
