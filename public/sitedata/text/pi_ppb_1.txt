<episode>Starting the Conversation<index>PRENATAL, PREGNANCY AND BIRTH | 1<tagline>You just found out you are pregnant. What now?<image>card_pi_ppb_1_1<takeaway>There is so much to learn and lots of information available. An EY Visitor is a valuable resource as you start to think about becoming a mother.<overview>Now what happens? Finding the right information and educational material is a good place to start for expectant moms and families. The EY Visitor can help guide caregivers to the experts and resources they will need while pregnant, giving birth, and as parents. Caregivers have all the tools and supports they need, but may require some help in identifying and using them.<practice>Review the resource Healthy Parents, Healthy Children. There is also a series of pamphlets to support healthy pregnancy that are available for the EY Visitor to use as well as the Inunnguinq Childrearing Advice from Inuit Elders booklet. The EY Visitor and mother can review this information together, discuss websites the EY Program refers to for pregnancy information, and discuss community supports. There are many useful apps online that you can access for free which can give you weekly updates on what is changing physically and emotionally inside you, and describe how baby is growing. It’s also a good idea to list all relevant community resources and, if possible, visit them in person to see what services are available.<reflection>What supports do you have around you? Who can you ask to support you?How might you approach those people?How will you support your baby’s development in all areas? What teachings do you know about pregnancy?Who can help you learn more about your role in guiding baby throughout her life?<keywords>Parenting; partner; relationship; expectations; planning; birth; family; feeding baby; breastfeeding; formula; labour; prenatal; support; community; choice<episode>A Healthy Pregnancy<index>PRENATAL, PREGNANCY AND BIRTH | 2<tagline>Keep a calendar of prenatal appointments.<image>card_pi_ppb_1_1<takeaway>Regular prenatal care helps to build a healthy baby.<overview>Regular prenatal check-ups with a health practitioner—doctor, midwife, or nurse practitioner—are the basic building blocks to a healthy pregnancy and a healthy newborn.<practice>Pregnant women can have a prenatal check-up as soon as they suspect or know they are pregnant. Encourage pregnant women to call the local health care/birthing centre and make their first prenatal appointment. At the first visit there will be lots of questions about medical history, and there may be a pregnancy test, pelvic exam, Pap smear, blood test, urine test, and blood pressure measurement. At some point during the pregnancy, an ultrasound will probably be booked. This often requires travel outside the community and might be a bit of a frightening experience. Information to prepare a woman for this is important to have available.Most pregnant women can expect about seven prenatal care appointments. It is important for them to go to all the appointments. The sooner the mother connects with health care staff to see her through her pregnancy and birth, the sooner she can start building a relationship with the supporting staff, so they can get track her health and progress. This will help her to feel more confident and relaxed throughout the pregnancy. However, often these appointments are rushed and routine. When information is not available, the EY Visitor and help to link a pregnant woman with those who have experience to help.<reflection>What are some questions you can ask at your next prenatal appointment? How will you get there?Who will come with you?Did you feel heard and supported at your last appointment?Is there information you want, but did not get from the health care staff? Wellness involves the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual self.How will you nurture your whole self throughout pregnancy?

Eating healthy foods and following a healthy lifestyle will give your baby a healthy start and help your own body support pregnancy and birth.<overview>During pregnancy a woman is responsible for creating a healthy home for baby in the womb. What you eat during your pregnancy will affect the health and growth of your baby as well as impact on your own long-term health. Women are encouraged to pay special attention to what they are eating in order to have an easier delivery and a heathier pregnancy. Calcium and iron are important to get from organ meats, bone marrow, clams and rich broth. It is important to try to eat even if you are experiencing nausea. Drinking broth and lots of clean water will help. Country foods are your most nutritious option. A diet of starches, sugars and carbohydrates will result in a larger baby and a sluggish delivery. Avoid junk foods and high sugar drinks like pop and juices. Healthy eating during pregnancy will help you to produce more breastmilk to feed the baby as well and reduce your recovery time post-pregnancy.<practice>There are many supports available regarding healthy food consumption during pregnancy. Pregnant women are monitored to ensure that they eat, sleep and exercise well. Making sure that a pregnant woman has access to the health providing foods is the responsibility of the whole family. Help her to notice where calcium and iron are found in the foods she is eating. Discuss how family eating habits can support or hinder the pregnant woman’s efforts to be healthy. Suggest dietary changes that could improve her consumption of strong foods. Share some simple snack/ meal ideas.<reflection>What are the healthy foods you enjoy the most?Do you have good access to these foods?What are the unhealthy foods you need to avoid?How can you be supported to do this?What things can you add to your diet to ensure you have sufficient iron and calcium intake?<keywords>Pregnancy; prenatal; health; eating; stress; food; iron; calcium; lifestyle; baby’s health; meals; snacks; growth; development; vegetables; meat; nutrition; junk food; habits;<episode>Thinking About Motherhood<index>PRENATAL, PREGNANCY AND BIRTH | 4<tagline>Think about if/how you want to parent baby after s/he arrives. Discuss this with the baby’s father and begin to make decisions together. If you have agreed on custom adoption, you still have a responsibility to the child and to yourself to have a very healthy pregnancy.<image>card_pi_ppb_1_1<takeaway>Talking about the role and responsibility of being a mom and a dad can help new parents to calm nerves and set some parenting goals before they actually have to parent. A woman who opts for custom adoption should very thoroughly prepare for this decision and be careful to connect with the prospective parents to plan for the birth together.<overview>Newly pregnant women can feel nervous about becoming a mom or becoming a mom of multiple children. For Inuit, there is often the decision to use custom adoptions as a way to provide a home for a child when the mother is too young, has too many other children, is not in a stable/supportive relationship, or is experiencing health difficulties. Sometimes the decision revolves around the issue of another woman not being able to have children herself. These discussions can be very emotional and the EY Visitor will need to involve other friends or family members in the discussions while making sure that the pregnant woman is not pressured and is free to make the best decision for herself. EY Visitors can play an essential part in supporting parents in their new roles and let them know that no matter what, they are the perfect parents to raise their child. Caregivers often raise children in the ways that they were raised. Pregnancy can be a pivotal point for a new parent to determine which of their caregivers’ parenting approaches they want to carry on.<practice>Write down some feelings about becoming a parent. What do you want baby to know? How will you teach her? Think about the important adults in your life when you were a child. What made them so special to you? What teachings or traditions do you want to incorporate in raising baby? Who is able to support you through your pregnancy/birth and early days as a mother? Are you actively planning you path ahead with the father of your baby, with your family?<reflection>Do you know any moms that you admire?Do you have parenting role models?How will the baby’s father and your family members share the responsibility of parenting with you?<keywords>Pregnancy; relationships; motherhood; love; parent-child; teaching; support; parenthood; feelings; parenting styles; goals; planning; responsibilities; adoption;<episode>Love Builds Brains<index>PRENATAL, PREGNANCY AND BIRTH | 5<tagline>Showing baby consistent and thoughtful love before birth and throughout her life is the most important way to build her heart and her brain.<image>card_pi_ppb_1_1<takeaway>Talking to and touching your belly and baby are the best ways to help baby develop her senses, her sense of attachment and build developmental pathways in her brain. Expose your baby to the people and voices that will be important in her life.<overview>The construction of a child’s brain begins during the first week after conception, which is before most women know that they are pregnant. Early nurturing care and positive experiences grounded in a secure parental attachment are important. They will have a positive effect on a baby’s health, learning, and behaviour later in life.<practice>Interact with baby frequently, talking and playing intentionally and respectfully. Stimulate baby’s senses with new sounds, objects, and foods. Pay careful attention to her cues so you know when she has had enough. Move the baby around and gently massage your stomach and muscles. Do not lie on one side too long. Be active throughout your pregnancy and especially in the last trimester. Be alert to baby showing signs of distress. Be prepared to meet your child’s needs by providing a reliable, safe, and secure environment.<reflection>What do you know already about baby’s development?

Trimester 3: 28 weeks to 36–40 weeks: Most organs are fully developed.<image>card_pi_ppb_1_1<takeaway>It takes about 40 weeks for a full-term baby to develop from a sperm and an egg.<overview>Once parents understand prenatal development and the remarkable growth of a single fertilized egg into a newborn baby, you realize how vital the prenatal environment—the pregnant woman’s body—is. Baby responds to what her mother hears, smells, and feels. The well-being of a pregnant woman is everyone’s responsibility.<practice>Learn about how baby is developing and what parts are developed in each trimester. The second trimester is where she is beginning to take in information through her senses. As an example, baby’s hearing develops in the second trimester, this is a good time to pray out loud, sing, drum, or listen to music. Read to baby. Baby will remember her experiences with music and stories, and she will show preference for the songs/ stories she heard before birth. Practice taking time to relax and focus on good feelings. Baby will remember these feelings after she is born.<reflection>What do you know about prenatal development? What trimester are you in?Do you feel baby?Have you had any pregnancies before?

Healthy lung development is important, starting in the womb.3-5 weeks: 2 lungs are formed and baby practices breathing fluids.5-16 weeks: Airways and air sacs have developed.16-26 weeks: Blood vessels grow around the air sacs.26-40 weeks: Fats and proteins prepare the lungs for breathing air.<image>card_pi_ppb_1_1<takeaway>Smoking and second-hand smoke alter healthy lung development.<overview>Many Inuit children are susceptible to respiratory diseases. These can be life threatening. The best way to support healthy lung development is to ensure that baby has a smoke-free environment. Smoking during pregnancy affects the heart and lung development of the fetus. It can result in a baby being born early, with a lower birthweight and weak. Smoking can also cause certain birth defects and lead to increased occurrences of SIDs (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome). Smoking also increases the likelihood of miscarriage and stillbirth. It can lead to complications with the placenta, including placenta previa where the placenta tears and placenta abruption where the placenta separates. Both occurrences can be life threatening to mother and child.<practice>Before you consider becoming pregnant, stop smoking. When you find yourself pregnant, immediately stop smoking if you can. Seek out supports from your partner and family in order to do this. Avoid smoke-filled areas. Try to get plenty of fresh air daily and find activities to reduce your craving for tobacco.<reflection>A healthy pregnancy requires that I stop smoking? What can you do to make sure you stay away from tobacco products? Are their heavy smokers in your family that you need to avoid?Are there places in your community that you need to avoid?What activities can you become engaged in that will help reduce my cravings for tobacco?<keywords>Health; respiratory; illness; breath; breathing; smoking; environment; tobacco; lung development; fetal; fetus; prenatal; postnatal; fresh-air; second-hand smoke; smoke-free; heart development; low birth weight; complications<episode>Roots and Wings<index>PRENATAL, PREGNANCY AND BIRTH | 8<tagline>Think about your childhood.

How do Inuit naming and birth blessings help create a life path for a child?<image>card_pi_ppb_1_1<takeaway>Thinking about your child’s future helps you make positive choices now and prepare a good path forward for your child.<overview>Attachment starts well before the birth of baby. It begins by looking after yourself while you are pregnant.<practice>Adults and the EY Visitor can work together to find grandmothers/Elders who can share knowledge about the ceremony of birth. Creation stories hold many teachings that mothers may connect to. Mothers can plan for the naming of their child, the people to involve in blessing the child and the sanajii/maker who will help set the child on a good path in life.There are many teachings about how to prepare for a healthy birth and baby. There are many expectations for how families support a pregnant woman and her child. When mothers understand the power they have, they will feel empowered. Baby feels everything mom feels, so this sets the stage for strong development to occur. Pregnant mothers can focus on this being a time to connect with baby physically and spiritually. EY Visitors can help mothers to understand the honour that is motherhood. Baby’s spirit chose their parents as the perfect people to guide them on their life path. Valuing that strong connection will help baby start her life in a good way.<reflection>Are there any teachings you remember about raising children?

What foods are especially reserved for pregnant women and why?<image>card_pi_ppb_1_1<takeaway>Healthy eating during pregnancy is important for the health of pregnant women and their developing babies.<overview>Encourage pregnant women to eat a variety of nutritious foods, including fruits, vegetables, meat or other proteins, and whole grains. An Inuit diet should consist of high intake of proteins and fats. The Inuit metabolism does not process carbohydrates well. Refined and highly processed carbohydrates generally turn to sugars in Inuit. Provide information about good foods and bad foods for Inuit.<practice>Review nutrition guidelines for Inuit and discuss different food groups; EY Visitors can go to the grocery store with parents and focus on how to choose healthy items when shopping. Discuss foods that are high in iron and calcium. A prenatal vitamin can help to supplement nutrients that contribute to healthy pregnancies such as iron and calcium that may be found in foods that are not available, or any foods that pregnant women may find unappealing. Non-insured health benefits cover prenatal vitamins with a prescription from a healthcare provider. Determine possible strategies if the cost of healthy food is a barrier. There are many foods which have a higher food value and cost considerably less if they are prepared from scratch rather than pre-packaged (ie. Home baked beans vs canned, homemade yoghurt vs. store-bought). Look for online sites to help with healthy eating: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPXxNwplOM5lao8kr3QinU_xW3Ile3iG7; https://www.aqqiumavvik. com/culture-of-cooking-1.<reflection>What are your favourite foods?

There is no safe amount of alcohol during pregnancy. If you take drugs during pregnancy, your baby is on drugs as well. Substance use can result in birth defects and in developmental challenges for the child throughout life. Stimulants limit how much food and oxygen unborn babies get and can cause miscarriages and still births. You also need to consider the drugs/chemicals found in foods. For example, a pregnant woman should not consume more than 1 L of diet pop daily which contains aspartame.<practice>If possible, women are advised to stop drinking, smoking, and using other substances before they get pregnant. If the pregnancy is unplanned, it is best to quit as soon as the mother thinks she might be pregnant. Pregnant women should ask their healthcare practitioner before taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter products, or herbal products. Be aware that some women may not be able to stop smoking, drinking, or drug use immediately; if that is the case, EY Visitors should focus on harm reduction and positive reinforcement of all efforts a woman makes towards cutting back on these substances. The woman’s family and support system should also be involved in supporting harm reduction. This could then become a topic for ongoing discussion and support.<reflection>Do you smoke? How do you think this affects baby?If you did not smoke, what are some positives for both you and baby?Have you ever witnessed a family who struggled with drugs or alcohol?How were their children affected?How do these substances impact healthy development of the baby?What good choices do you want to make about your pregnancy?<keywords>Drugs; alcohol; health; smoking; prenatal; development; pregnancy; harm-reduction; brain development; physical, emotional; stress; experiences; relationships; environment<episode>Talk to Your Unborn Baby<index>PRENATAL, PREGNANCY AND BIRTH | 11<tagline>Sing songs and talk to your developing baby.<image>card_pi_ppb_1_1<takeaway>Baby can hear when she is in the womb, and her language skills start to develop. Baby recognizes and responds to her mother’s voice and the voices of important others after birth.<overview>Unborn babies can hear sounds and see light and shadows from about 24 weeks. This is a time to stimulate your baby. Tell stories, sing and talk gently to your baby. Have others do the same so that baby can be welcomed by people she has come to know. Mothers can get excited about prenatal milestones, especially if they know that their unborn baby can now hear their voices. It starts to build a bond between the mother and her unborn baby. Unborn babies can also respond to touch, light, and taste. Massage your baby and gently move it around.<practice>In a quiet and relaxing environment pay attention to what baby is doing. Is she moving, kicking, or turning over? Try singing out loud to baby while rubbing the pregnant mother's belly. Do baby’s movements change? This is one of the first baby-caregiver interactions; an early serve and return. Some other options are to drum, shake a rattle, dance, or speak to her in your Inuktut. Wait to see how she responds.<reflection>Do you notice how baby’s movements change depending on your activity?Does baby get excited or respond with movements when she hears or feels something in particular?

Your partner also needs to understand his role in supporting a healthy pregnancy.<image>card_pi_ppb_1_1<takeaway>Parents need support from each other and from all generations in their family and community. Grandmothers, aunties, and good friends can be a big help during pregnancy, childbirth and with a new baby.<overview>A pregnant woman’s social networks and a sense of belonging are key to her having healthy coping strategies to manage her stress. Inuit are grounded by their network of relationships. These relationships are key in providing support through pregnancy.<practice>When a woman shares the news of her pregnancy, her friends and family often say they will help with whatever she needs, all she has to do is ask. However, for a variety of reasons, an expectant mother can be reluctant to ask for help. The EY Visitor can encourage the pregnant mother to recognize the sources of strength that are meaningful and already present in her life, like grandmothers, aunties and other family members, and draw on the gifts these supporters can offer her.<reflection>Who else is excited about your pregnancy?Who is close to you that can be a reliable support?How can you ask for more support from a family member or friend?

Almost all pregnant women feel sad or worried to some degree during their pregnancy; this is normal and healthy. Some of these feelings can be caused by normal physical and hormonal changes that take place during pregnancy. Family and supporters need to find ways to reduce stress at this time and to encourage healthy practices to prepare for a good delivery and birth.<practice>Eating well, getting some form of exercise, sleeping well, being outside, and connecting with her community network all help a pregnant woman cope with her emotions. For some, taking time to be totally alone is also important. Consider asking the mother-to-be to make a list of things she likes to do, and what makes her feel safe and comfortable. Talk about her feelings and who is there to support her. Remind her that for the first few weeks, a mother’s only job is to support baby. Her network is there to help her in accomplishing that.<reflection>What do you love to do alone?

Try to make sure you are living in a calming environment.<overview>When a pregnant woman is stressed, her unborn baby is stressed. Stress and pregnancy both use a lot of energy. Being tired can lead to even more stress and it can become a difficult cycle to break. It can also lead to higher blood pressure during pregnancy. Chronic stress can increase the chances of an early labour or of delivering baby with a low birth weight. Teaching a woman ways she can cope with stress while she is pregnant helps build her coping skills for the normal, everyday stresses of being a new mother. It also give her more day-to-day energy.<practice>Determine community resources that can help reduce stress. Together, EY Visitor and mother can make a list of ways to manage stress. Consider parent groups, going for walks together or grocery shopping alone.<reflection>What is causing your stress?

Start preparing your body now to produce strong breast milk.<image>card_pi_ppb_1_2<takeaway>Breastfeeding is the healthiest choice for baby and has many benefits for mom. Breast milk contains vitamins and nutrients that baby needs for good health. It also protects baby from many kinds of infections and diseases.<overview>When baby is breastfed, she develops more immunity to infections and asthma. Breast milk is easier to digest, free, and readily available—it does not require bottles, sterilization, or buying expensive formula. Breastfeeding decreases the mother’s risk of cancers and postpartum depression. It also helps with weight loss and in forming a strong bond between the mother and her infant. Breastfeeding will also delay the next pregnancy. There are many very good resources which provide detailed information about breastfeeding: https://livehealthy.gov.nu.ca/sites/default/files/Breastfeeding%20Basics.pdf; https:// www.pharmacists.ca/cpha-ca/assets/File/education-practice-resources/BreastfeedingPHACworkbook.pdf; https://www. aqqiumavvik.com/maternal-wellness-resources.<practice>Breastfeeding is not as easy as it looks. Some people are naturals, but many face more challenges. These challenges can include sore, cracked, and/or dry nipples; blocked ducts; inverted nipples; and difficulties getting premature babies to breastfeed. However, if you are experiencing these challenges there are supports available to help you accomplish your goal of breastfeeding. Inuit Elders are experts in breastfeeding issues. Find someone in your family/community to help. They can provide valuable support in managing a new mother’s expectations. They will let mom know that it can take up to a month—or longer—for mom and baby to get comfortable with breastfeeding. It is important not to give up because both you and your baby will benefit in many ways from being breastfed. Before giving birth, make sure that you eat well to help produce strong breast milk, Animal broths are very important for breastfeeding but also for a smooth delivery. It is important to put your baby to your breast right after birth, even it the baby is not yet ready to suck. Also keep the baby on the breast even if your milk is no longer flowing. This will tell your body how much milk to produce. If you leave milk in your breast, it will harden and produce less milk. If you are producing too much milk, wake the baby up to nurse by gently rubbing the side of the cheek or head. Feed babies on demand, alternating equally between breasts.<reflection>Have you breastfed before? How do you feel about breastfeeding?What teachings do you know about breastfeeding?

It also helps build connections with all family members.<practice>Adults can keep baby safe by bedding her down in the same room where the mother is. Baby could sleep on a separate, safe sleep surface, like a crib, for the first six months. This is called “room sharing,” and helps reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome SIDS. Many Inuit prefer to co-sleep with their baby. Adult mattresses are not built for babies to sleep on because they are too soft, so it is important to use a firm mattress when co-sleeping and to protect baby well within the bed space. Be very conscious of any loose materials such as blankets around baby’s face. Inuit advise parents to allow baby to sleep around a certain level of noise, so they are able to sleep through interruptions. Sit up to breastfed. Do not fed your baby lying down in bed.Remember to always place baby on her back to sleep for naps and at night. This is the safest way for baby to sleep. Adults can whisper “Look up to our ancestors” when they put baby to sleep.<reflection>How can you make sure that baby is safe and feels secure while sleeping?What has your family used in the past?Observe your baby’s sleep preferences and adjust your practices to them.What have you noticed?Do you try to sleep when baby sleeps?<keywords>ABC's; alone; back; crib; safe sleep; safety; SIDS; bedsharing; crib; co-sleeping; benefits; risks; Bedsharing; co-sleeping; breastfeeding; SIDS; ABC's; death; risks; mattress; alcohol; exhaustion; Nature; Creator; Mother Earth; song; knowing and being; gift; spirit world; spirit to child; spirit blanket; rocking; water spirit; placenta; moss bag; swing; spine, nervous system; muscular strength; swing; spirit to child transition; balance; moving; safe; protection; loved; Moss bag; healing; protection; safe; smell; sight; hear; traditional roles; carrying child on back; awareness; looking out; Safe sleep; safety; SIDS; bedsharing; crib; co-sleeping; benefits; risks; gifts; Creator; Safe sleep; safety; SIDS; bedsharing; crib; co-sleeping; benefits; risks; gifts; Creator; support; community; mother-child; smoking; breastfeeding; mother-child; parent-child; colic; spitting up; alcohol; sleep surfaces; crib; swaddle; purple crying; Safe sleep; safety; SIDS; bedsharing; crib; co-sleeping; benefits; risks; gifts; Creator; support; community; mother-child; smoking; breastfeeding; mother-child; parent-child; colic; spitting up; alcohol; sleep surfaces; crib; swaddle; purple crying;<episode>Dressing Baby<index>PRENATAL, PREGNANCY AND BIRTH | 17<tagline>Think about the basic items baby needs to be safe, warm, and comfortable. Clothing should allow baby to move easily.<image>card_pi_ppb_1_2<takeaway>Dressing baby appropriately for the season means she is not too hot and not too cold.<overview>Until baby is about 6 months to a year old, she may need some help regulating her body temperature. This depends on baby’s weight, if she is petite, she may need more layers. This is also why parents do so much skin-to-skin time with their newborn. Adult’s bodies adjust based on their environment and since baby was in a womb at the perfect temperature for so long, her body needs time to build this skill. Dress baby in the same number of layers that you are wearing, plus one. However, remember that baby might also have the additional covering of a bunting bag and amautik. Babies can very easily overheat so it is important to check on baby regularly when being carried. Be aware of overdressing or underdressing baby at certain times of the year. Babies will always need a hat/ear covering to protect themselves from wind. Baby also needs loose, comfortable clothes that allow for movement and do not constrict in any way. If possible, keep the house between 20.0° Celsius and 23.8° Celsius during the day. At night, the house should be no cooler than 16.0° Celsius. Premature babies may need an extra layer of clothing until they reach their full-term due date. If you are wrapping baby and using a bunting bag, check the baby often to make sure it is comfortable and not becoming too hot.<practice>On hot days in the summer when adults are wearing short sleeves, baby can be protected from the sun’s UV rays by keeping her in the shade or dressing her in loose, light fabrics to cover her skin. Always cover her head/ears with a hat.When going from a cold outside to a warm inside, make sure to take off a layer, even if baby is asleep. This can be made easier by dressing her in lighter clothes and layering her in blankets or a warm bunting bag for easy removal. People lose the most heat from the tops of their head so make sure babies always wear warm hats outside to keep warm and to protect the ears. Ear infections must always be guarded against as Inuit are very susceptible to hearing loss through ear infections.The best place to check baby’s temperature is the chest, back, or neck. Reach two fingers into the collar of her snowsuit to check her temperature. Adults should trust their instincts. If baby is too hot, her skin may be beet red, or have a pin-point rash, or be hot to touch. Baby could also be hard to wake up or unresponsive, and even vomiting.<reflection>How can you tell if baby is comfortable?During what month will baby be born?What can you have ready for the season?Do you need to reach out to any resources for items that you don’t have access to? Who can help you sew for baby and your amautik?Do you need my support to get these items, or can you do it yourself?<keywords>How to dress; clothing; newborn; layers; car seat; safety; blankets; overheating; temperature; sun; sewing;<episode>Baby on the Move<index>PRENATAL, PREGNANCY AND BIRTH | 18<tagline>The warmest way for your baby to travel with you is in the amautiq. Consider a bunting bag to make it easier to pack your baby.<image>card_pi_ppb_1_2<takeaway>Having baby warm and close to you, that is the safest place for baby to be and builds attachment.<overview>Make sure that the pouch of your amautik is the right size for baby. A young baby should be bundled so that she does not slip sideways in the amautik. Baby’s head is large and heavy, and her neck muscles are weak. Make sure that the head is supported by the back of the amautik. When riding in a car you might want to consider a car seat to give her proper support and ensure her safety. It is recommended that adults use a rear-facing child safety seat for as long as possible. In the south, children must ride in a car seat until they are at least 5 years old or more than 40 pounds. Children 8 years old and under must ride in a booster seat until they are at least 4 feet 9 inches tall or 80 pounds. If you are travelling with baby on a snowmobile or ATV, always make sure that the child is protected from the wind and weather. It is best to cover the child entirely while riding.<practice>An EY Visitor can support expectant parents to go look at proper amautik styles for an infant and also to look for items like hats, mitts, kamiit and bunting bags, other types of carriers and car seats. Baby’s feet will be warmest in kamiit or soft boots that are flexible when she is being carried. Look at the various types of seasonal clothing for an infant and determine what might best suit the child’s growth at the appropriate seasons.<reflection>What is your most frequent mode of transportation?How can you access what you need to keep baby safe?What clothing do you need to have available for baby according to the seasons at birth and the first 6 months?

There are difficult considerations when giving birth away from home. Know what to expect.<image>card_pi_ppb_1_2<takeaway>A birth plan lets the medical team know your concerns in advance.<overview>Deciding how and where you want to have baby is generally a decision over which you have no control. You can however decide who will accompany you and support you during the labour and birth. It helps to make as many important decisions as possible before going into labour. A mother should tell her plans to the people around her. That way, even if she is unable to advocate for herself, there is someone there to support her. You need to plan what to pack and how to occupy yourself for the month that you will be away from home. Plan what things you need for the baby and to be able to travel comfortably with the baby. Talk with your escort about the ways you want to keep busy and healthy while you are away. Plan for how to maintain contact with your family at home and those who are supporting you.<practice>EY visitors can discuss who is going to be in the delivery room with the mother, how she will get to the hospital, and what she should take to the hospital. Discuss who else knows about the birth plan and who she trusts to make decisions in case of emergency. The mother should bring a list of questions to medical appointments, so she doesn’t forget what she would like to ask the health care providers. The mother can ask about what pain medications or options she may wish to use during birth. It is a good idea for the mother to have decided on these things before she goes into labour while recognizing the delivery may not go exactly as planned. Her escort should have her written plan when she goes into hospital to ensure her needs and wishes are met.Seek out information on prenatal classes held by the local health authority and at the transient facility. EY Visitors and parents can look at a schedule of the classes and make sure they have the number of the local maternal child health nurse. She can be a good resource for you, the mother, and the mother’s family. Being in the south for delivery gives mothers access to a wide range of services which are not available in the north. Try to find out about these in advance and take advantage of them while you are waiting.<reflection>If you have had a baby before, what went well that you would like to ensure happens again? What would you like to do differently?What information do you need to have in order to make a birth plan?Who will be your escort?

Many Inuit babies are born out of territory and will receive a provincial birth certificate. The Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated (NTI) beneficiary form confirms your baby’s rights as a Beneficiary of the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (NLCA).<overview>Baby’s birth registration is the official recognition of her birth and her identity as a Canadian citizen. Birth registration ensures that baby has access to government programs, including health care, education, and social services. When you return to Nunavut, apply for a Nunavut health care card and NTI registration to make sure baby is properly registered.<practice>You will be given forms to sign at the time of your baby’s birth. Initially there is a hospital form giving details of the baby’s identity. Make sure that the information is correct, and the spelling of the baby’s name are correct. It will be difficult and expensive to make changes later. The hospital will also provide forms to apply for a provincial birth certificate. Again, be careful that all the information is correct. You will receive the provincial birth certificate in the mail. Carry a copy of the hospital registration with you. Provide a copy of this to your local health centre so that the baby is registered in Nunavut and receives a health care card. You can also use this document to register your baby as an NTI beneficiary.<reflection>Have you registered your other children?Why is it important for you to know your baby is a beneficiary?Why is it important to get a correct birth certificate?<keywords>Registration; birth; government; how-to; status card; birth certificate; belonging; community; rights; beneficiary forms; identity;<episode>Preparing for Labour<index>PRENATAL, PREGNANCY AND BIRTH | 21<tagline>Giving birth can be intimidating; however, the more prepared you are mentally and physically, the more you will be able to handle decision making in the moment. Breathing rather than yelling or walking around and keeping active will help with the birth. You may want to give birth sitting or standing up rather than lying down.<image>card_pi_ppb_1_2<takeaway>An expectant mom may have some fears or anxieties about giving birth. Talking about these before going into labour can help her feel mentally prepared for the experience.<overview>Unexpected things happen during the process of labour and giving birth. Thinking about an upcoming birth and talking to someone about it before it happens is a good way to prepare mentally. Make sure your escort knows what your plan and preferences are.<practice>EY Visitors and parents can have a conversation about giving birth. Take turns expressing fears and listening to each other’s fears. Naming and expressing anxieties are good ways to let it go. Planning and preparing will help you remain calm. Inuit say never to yell during labour because that takes up your energy, causes tension for you and your child and will slow the delivery. Inuit prefer to give birth from a standing or squatting positionso that gravity helps with the birth. These positions need to be supported by people you are comfortable with. Remember that a woman’s gift and her body is designed for this task. If you have taken care of yourself to have a healthy pregnancy you are most likely to have a smooth and safe delivery. To slow bleeding after giving birth, drink plenty of warm water.<reflection>What are your expectations around giving birth?Are you excited and looking forward to this?Do you have any anxieties about your birth and if so, what are they?How can you make yourself more prepared for the birth?Who will be with you in your delivery?

Becoming a mother for the first time can be an adjustment as well. Taking time to talk about the experience with someone who can relate might be healing. It can also help parents to feel a sense of support and community. It is important to share your birth story with the important people in the life of your child – their avvaq, sanajii, extended family.<practice>Think about your birth experience by talking about what was positive and negative.
