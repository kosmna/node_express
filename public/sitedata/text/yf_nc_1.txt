<episode>Breastfeeding Connection<index>Nurturing Care | 1<title>"I will hold you close while feeding you."<tagline>Breastfeed your baby.<takeaway>Breastfeeding is an opportunity for skin-to-skin contact, which is one way for a mom to build a strong bond with her baby.<overview>Skin-to-skin contact immediately after birth provides tactile stimulation that releases hormones. This encourages brain development. Skin-to-skin contact stimulates a baby to look for the mother’s breast and helps promote successful breastfeeding. Newborns who are held directly against their mom’s body cry less, sleep longer and experience physical benefits (better body temperature regulation and better blood-sugar stability) in the months after birth.<practice> Talk to Mom about how breastfeeding is a good opportunity for skin-to-skin contact. It helps create a bond with the baby and is a first step in establishing a nurturing, caring relationship. Encourage Mom to try skin-to-skin contact when her baby is having trouble settling down. She can also try talking to her baby to soothe her while holding her close.<reflection> How do you feel while breastfeeding your baby? How does your baby feel before, during and after breastfeeding? How can you include language during this special time together? Was this a natural part of parenting in your home?<keywords>Skin-to-skin; nuturting; bonding; mother-child; parent-child; eye contact; senses; affection; touch; stress; 0-5 weeks; Breastfeeding; milk; engorgement; blocked; ducts; colostrum; formula; night feedings; mother-child; bond; nutrition
<episode>A Feeling of Trust<index>Nurturing Care | 2<title>"I will keep you safe."<tagline>Use gentle hands and a kind voice when carrying out your baby’s daily routines.<takeaway>A steady source of comfort makes your baby feel safe and secure. It builds a feeling of trust. <overview>In the first year of her life, a baby is very vulnerable. She depends completely on others to take care of her. When parents/caregivers provide her with nurturing care, she develops a sense of trust in the adults around her. This lays the groundwork for the way she will approach new situations and people. Developing a sense of trust in the first year of life results in more optimistic beliefs about the world. Opportunities to cuddle and comfort babies when you preform daily routines lets babies know that they can trust that their needs will be met.A baby is comforted when she is held close and can hear someone’s heartbeat. At around 6 weeks of age, when she is cuddled, rocked and spoken to in a soft voice, a baby starts to respond by watching, snuggling or smiling. These are all signs of a baby’s trust.<practice>Talk to Mom about traditional ways of comforting children. Indigenous parents and communities have always seen themselves as responsible for the spirit of their children. They met the immediate needs of babies and young children and comforted them when they cry. Everyone was responsible for watching over the children in a community and teaching them about the world around them.<reflection>As a child, who were the people you knew you could trust? Were they family members or family friends?What was it about them that made you feel safe?How can you mimic those qualities for your own child?Who can you trust today in your adult life? Will they be part of your child’s community?<keywords>Secure; attachment; oxytocin; joy; safe; feelings; emotions; name it; affection; love; eye contact; spoil; mistakes; self-worth; self-regulate; guidance; protection; bigger; stronger; wiser; kind; trust; Secure; attachment; exploration; support; safety; protect; comfort; self-regulate; emotions; needs; responsible; guidance; protection; bigger; stronger; wiser; kind; trust; Behaviour; attention; connection; communication; secure; base; attachment; control; rewards; unconditional; love; safety; nurturing; connection; self-regulate
<episode>Recognise and Respond<index>Nurturing Care | 3<title>"I am listening."<tagline>Watch for your baby to make eye contact, move and make sounds. Think about what she is telling you and respond.<takeaway>When adults pay attention to a baby’s attempts to communicate, she will know someone is there for her. <overview>Babies sends signals to adults to let them know what they need or want. These non-verbal signals signals—including eye contact, smiling, wiggling, reaching out and crying—are the beginning of conversations. When adults respond promptly, a baby starts to understand the benefits of looking for help. A baby does not have the maturity yet to manage her own emotions, but when adults respond to her and guide her, she starts to learn the skills she will need to soothe herself. When newborns are learning to regulate their eating and sleeping, consistent, responsive soothing helps them feel content, safe and secure.<practice>One of the most important tasks for Mom in the first few months of her baby’s life is to help her baby feel comfortable in the world. As a Visitor, encourage Mom to be aware of her baby’s signals and to pay attention to how she responds to her baby. <reflection>How do you react to your baby’s cues?How can you make sure that you respond positively to baby’s various expressions of emotion? What calms you when you’re feeling upset?How does your baby communicate with you?<keywords>Autonomy; supervision; feelings; temperament; distress; responsive; nurturing; identify; emotion; expression; self-regulate; pateince; kindness; love; Self-regulation; stress; emotion; reponsiveness; nurturing; serve & return; hovering; helicopter; overbearing; over-responsiveness; sensitive; communication; signals; wants; needs; balance; Self-regulation; stress; emotion; calm; alert; happy; inhibition; arousal; activation; Communication; responsiveness; over-responsiveness; eye contact; avoidance; ignore; signals; wants; balance; sensitive; autonomy; parent-child; cues; serve and return
<episode>Diapering<index>Nurturing Care | 4<title>"Here are your toes and here is your tummy."<tagline>Talk, sing or play during diaper changing.<takeaway>Diaper changing is a predictable part of a baby’s day. Positive interactions during these times will help make the routine an enjoyable experience.<overview>Repeated conversations, rhymes and songs comfort babies. A caring, responsive adult can soothe a baby with a soft tone and let the baby know what is going to happen next. Doing this promotes a trusting relationship and helps the baby learn to anticipate what will happen next, which helps her build an ability to self-regulate before a change or discomfort. Over time, babies begin to internalize their feelings of safety and predictability while being changed; they feel secure because they know what to expect. <practice>Talk to Mom about diapering routines. Because they happen several times every day, they are an excellent opportunity for one-on-one talk time. Diapering is a time when Mom can soothe her baby by talking to her about what is happening and making her feel less vulnerable or uncomfortable. Ask Mom to notice how her baby reacts when she talks to her and gives her things to hold during diaper changing. As the diapering routine becomes a daily care ritual with a predictable pattern, she will likely see her baby become more relaxed and content.<reflection>Who are the primary caregivers in your baby’s life who can help with her care? Where are the opportunities to play or be silly during diapering?What parts of diapering can your baby be involved in?Which diapering supplies are safe for a baby to hold and explore? What concepts can you talk about during this time?

<episode>Baby Massage<index>Nurturing Care | 5<title>"You like having your tummy rubbed."<tagline>Gently stroke your baby’s body.<takeaway>Massage promotes bonding and your baby’s sense of touch. It also reduces your baby’s stress. <overview>High levels of stress can be harmful to a baby’s developing brain. Massage decreases levels of a stress hormone called cortisol and increases levels of the two "feel good” hormones, serotonin and dopamine. Serotonin helps balance mood, sleep patterns, appetite and pain awareness. Dopamine helps develop brain function, including memory, attention and problem-solving. Massage can also help a baby through painful times, such as teething.<practice>Help Mom learn to massage her baby, starting with her legs and feet, gently loosening joints. Move to the middle of her body and stroke her chest, tummy, shoulders and arms. Finish with gentle finger strokes on her head, around her eyes and her cheeks. <reflection>How can you prepare yourself, your baby and the environment for a relaxing experience? When is a good time of the day for your baby’s massage?What are your baby’s reactions to massage? How does your baby respond to touch?<keywords>Baby; massage; touch; senses; affection; touch; physical; psycho-social; attachment; safety; nurturing; care; love; Baby; massage; touch; senses; affection; touch; physical; psycho-social; attachment; safety; nurturing; care; love; stimulation; bond; mother-child; caregiver-child; sleep; coordination; cortisol; nervous system; weight gain; colic; fussiness
<episode>Baby Mouths<index>Nurturing Care | 6<title>"How do I take care of my baby’s new teeth?"<tagline>Make dental hygiene part of a daily routine with your baby.<takeaway>Introducing dental care early will help your baby get used to it. <overview>Taking care of a baby’s teeth is important to language development and overall health. Cleaning a baby’s mouth every day, from birth, ensures the formation of a good habit early on. A baby gets her first teeth between the ages of 6 and 8 months. It is important to care for them right from the start. Getting a tooth pulled in early childhood can affect language development.Parents/caregivers don’t always know that it is possible to pass the bacteria that causes tooth decay from their own mouths to their child. They should avoid using their own mouths to test the temperature of a bottle or clean a pacifier. They should also avoid sharing utensils (such as spoons) with their baby.<practice>Explain to Mom that the best way to make sure her baby’s teeth and gums stay healthy is to clean them after every feeding. Before her baby’s teeth come in, Mom can wrap a moistened washcloth around her index finger and gently massage the gums. Once a tooth appears, Mom can use a soft children’s toothbrush, without toothpaste, in addition to massaging the gums. When Mom notices that her baby is irritated by teething, you can suggest that she give her baby a clean teething ring or a cold wet washcloth. Cold temperatures can help soothe her baby when her teeth start to grow in. <reflection>Do you already have a mouth cleaning routine?Do you feel funny cleaning baby’s mouth even though she doesn't have any teeth? How does your baby react when you try to clean her mouth?<keywords>dental health; hygeine; eating
<episode>Teething<index>Nurturing Care | 7<title>"How can I provide baby with some relief?"<tagline>Help your baby to work through the pain of growing new teeth.<takeaway>Find what works best to help you and your baby cope while she is teething. <overview>Teething can start at about 5 months and can continue on and off until a baby is about 24 months. Most babies grow in one last set of molars by about 36 months. Every baby is on their own schedule. When she chews on her hands more or drools excessively, this might be signs that she is teething.Teething is stressful for both parents/caregivers and their baby, who is confused and in pain. Often, it can seem like she is crying for no reason. It’s not always possible to see when teeth start growing in. The pain will come and go with each new tooth. Some babies get fever or diarrhea when they are teething. Sometimes it can be hard to figure out if a baby has a cold, has the flu or is teething. Parents/caregivers should ask a healthcare professional or trusted expert if they are not sure.It can be difficult to keep in mind that teething is temporary and the pain will go away. The pain might interrupt sleep, which then interrupts the parent/caregiver’s sleep and can cause frustration. Often when a baby is teething, the best relief is to be held and cuddled. Parents/caregivers might want to trade off cuddling with their baby for a while.<practice>Mom can help her baby find relief while she is teething. You may want to suggest  that she buy different types of teethers. You can go with her to choose one. Tell her it should be simple and without extra parts. It should be easy for the baby to hold and should not be filled with a liquid. The liquid in some teethers can irritate the skin if the teether breaks open. Mom should sanitize the teether regularly.Mom can try tying a wet cloth in a knot and freezing it. This is helpful to have on hand in the freezer during a hard day. Sometimes a distraction is the best remedy. Try going outside for a walk or dance to music. This will help both Mom and her baby feel better.Once teething has started, a baby begins to discover how to use her teeth. She may start biting, which Mom might think is bad behaviour. You may want to remind her that her baby just needs something to chew on because chewing gives her relief from teething pain. If a baby has started to eat solid foods, Mom can give her cold, peeled cucumber, which is the perfect texture for a baby to chew on and it feels great on the gums. Remind Mom that it’s a good idea to supervise her baby with the cucumber to be sure she is not biting off pieces that are too big.<reflection>What are some ways that your baby lets you know she is teething? Who can you ask about teething if you need more information?How do you manage your stress when your baby is having trouble calming down?<keywords>teething; soothing; physical;
<episode>Bedtime Routine<index>Nurturing Care | 8<title>"I think you are getting sleepy. Let’s go find your special blanket."<tagline>Set a consistent, calming bedtime routine for your baby. It can include giving her a bath, brushing her teeth, changing her into pajamas and singing her a quiet song or reading a book.<takeaway>A bedtime routine tells your baby's body and brain that it’s time for sleep. <overview>Bedtime routines matter. Babies learn what to expect when routines are predictable. For example, a baby will learn that once she has had a bottle, read a book and the lights are turned off, it is time to be calm. Routines help create a smooth transition from daytime to nighttime and help a baby know what will happen next and what is expected of her.<practice>By the time a baby is about 6 months of age, Mom should have established a bedtime routine. You can explain that a routine makes it easier for her baby to calm down. Every night, Mom can do the routine in the same order. It should be simple and consistent. Suggest that Mom establish a routine, such as brushing teeth first, followed by pajamas, a book, a lullaby and then a cuddle. The end of this routine signals her baby that it’s time to go into her crib. Tell Mom to be patient because it might take a little time for her baby to get used to the routine. A routine will help her baby sleep for longer periods of time.<reflection>Do you feel calm during your baby’s bedtime routine? How do you know if your routine is effective?What are your feelings around having your baby "cry it out”? What do you usually do to prepare for your baby’s bedtime? What works for you and what might work better? Who else is involved in your baby’s bedtime routine? Why are bedtime routines important?<keywords>Sleep; difficulty; habits; routine; brain development; physical; moods; emotions; memoy; success at school; well-being; genetics; consistent; routine; awake; self-comfort
<episode>First, Next, Last<index>Nurturing Care | 9<title>"I am going to change your diaper and then we will have breakfast."<tagline>Tell your baby what’s on the day’s agenda by explaining what will happen first, next and last. <takeaway>Your baby feels more secure and comfortable when her daily routine is consistent. Knowing the agenda helps her anticipate what is coming next.<overview>As she grows up, your baby learns what to expect. As she gains experience, she will get better at choosing appropriate behaviours for the different situations she finds herself in. She will also get better at preparing for changes. This is part of a baby’s growing ability to self-regulate.<practice>Explain to Mom that giving her baby information about what is happening during daily routines and what is going to happen next helps her anticipate what is going on. It also helps build her vocabulary and communication skills. Suggest to Mom that it’s a good idea to keep the information simple; to not provide too many details or discuss events that are too far into the future. Mom can try describing one or two events that are happening in the very near future, such as, "Now we are going to get dressed and then we are going to go for a walk.”<reflection>What routines do you and your baby go through every day? When during the day do you already have a routine?When during the day would you like to start a routine?<keywords>Repetition; routine; security; predict; cause & effect; control; anticipate; consistent; safety; trust
<episode>First Foods<index>Nurturing Care | 10<title>"Do you want to try some carrots?"<tagline>When your baby is 5 to 6 months old, she will likely be ready to try solid food.<takeaway>Touching and tasting different types of food makes your baby curious and willing to try even more. <overview>At about 6 months of age, babies can start eating nutritious solid foods. Watch for the signs; if she is able to sit up on her own, move her head independently and is interested in what adults are eating, she is ready.<practice>Learning to eat food is messy work. Explain to Mom that her baby explores the world using her senses, so she needs to become familiar with food before trying it. Mom can let her baby feel the food with her hands and try to feed herself. It will be messy. Try having two spoons available—one for Mom and one for the baby. Mom should always stay close by to make sure her baby does not choke.<reflection>How much time do you allow for your baby’s meals? How can you encourage exploration of food as well as eating it? What do you do to prepare for the mess your baby will make?What is your reaction when your baby spills?What foods do you think your baby likes?<keywords>Breastfeeding; 6 months- 1 year; solid; food; growth; spurt; nutrition; health; milk; bond; texture; 6-9 months; 9-12 months; homemade; menus; Breakfast; feeding; baby; food; caregiver; serve & return; eye contact; smile; happy; communication
<episode>Sharing Feelings<index>Nurturing Care | 11<title>"You are smiling and seem happy. I am smiling too."<tagline>Make faces that mirror your baby’s facial expression and name what your baby is feeling.<takeaway>Your baby is starting to learn about her own emotions and other people’s emotions. <overview>Like older children and adults, babies experience many different emotions. When parents/caregivers acknowledge their baby’s emotions, they help her express and understand what she is feeling and thinking. This sets the foundation for her to learn about other people’s feelings and shows her that her parents, siblings and other people around her all have feelings too. This helps her know that it is okay to express emotions.<practice>Encourage Mom to label her baby’s physical actions and emotions; that will help teach her baby how to express her emotions. For example, saying, "I can see that you are crying; you must be feeling so sad,” helps her baby link the words "crying” and "sad” so she recognises the emotion better. Remind Mom to share her own feelings and to model coping skills. For example, Mom could say, "I am feeling sad. I’m going to make myself a cup of tea; that will help me feel better.”<reflection>What does your baby see on your face when you are feeling emotional? Do you remember to also express emotion when your feelings are positive?<keywords>Self-regulation; emotion; competence; feeling; empathy; temperament; adversity; cognitive; development; social; non-verbal; cues; identify; modelling; trauma; language; social-emotional;
<episode>Stranger Anxiety<index>Nurturing Care | 12<title>"My baby cries when others hold him."<tagline>Practise leaving your baby’s side for a few minutes at a time.<takeaway>Making strange is a sign that your baby is developing thinking skills and is becoming aware of the people around her.<overview>When a baby is about 6 months old, she might start to cry when she is in an unfamiliar situation or alone with unfamiliar people. This is a sign of healthy attachment; it means she recognises the difference between people she knows and trusts and people she does not. At 8 to 12 months of age, most babies go through a stage when "stranger anxiety” is at its peak. This period usually fades as she grows. Once she learns about object permanence—that objects exist even when they cannot be felt, seen or heard—she starts to feel better about her parents/caregivers leaving her and trusts that they will return.	<practice>If Mom is too excited when introducing her baby to family and friends or wants her baby to have the experience of sitting on Santa’s lap, her baby might become distressed. During her "stranger anxiety” phase, her baby might cry when she is in a place where she doesn’t feel safe. Talk to Mom about ways she can make her baby feel safe and comfortable even when she is in unfamiliar situations.Talk to Mom about strategies she can use to help her baby cope with stranger anxiety:• Introduce her baby to new people in an environment in which she is comfortable, whenever possible. This will make her feel more secure.• Let family and friends know that she will need a few minutes to get used to them before they get close to her.• Hold her and give her some time to get used to a new person before allowing that person to hold her.• Be prepared for her to need to be with someone she knows and trusts when she is meeting many new people at once.• Let her get to know new people gradually, at her own pace.• Demonstrate a warm and welcoming approach; if she sees that Mom is comfortable with the stranger, she can be too.<reflection>Does your baby make strange when friends or family hold her? Do strangers make your baby anxious?<keywords>attachment; bond; comfort; child's lead; anxiety; social-emotional
