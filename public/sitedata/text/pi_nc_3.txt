Naming Emotions

<index>
NURTURING CARE | 1

<title>
 “Your little sister fell down and now she’s crying. How do you think she’s feeling?”

<tagline>
Encourage a child to think about and describe her own emotions and those of others. 

<takeaway>
The ability to recognise and name emotions helps children make sense of their own feelings. 

<overview>
Children can have a hard time putting names to emotions when they are feeling them. Talking about emotions and noticing them in others helps children make sense of their own feelings. Being able to connect a word to an emotion helps them understand how they are feeling, allowing them to label their own emotions in the future. When parents/caregivers model and talk about emotions, children learn that emotions are normal and that they should be validated rather than buried or hidden.  

<practice>
<in the home>
Ask parents/caregivers to notice when their child is paying attention to another person’s emotions. They can describe to their child the emotion the person is feeling and ask questions to help her think about the emotion. They can say, “Your cousin seems upset. Why do you think she feels that way?” or “Look how excited that baby feels. What kinds of things make you feel excited?” You can try suggesting they give their child the time and space to think about the emotion and feel for the other person. Suggest that when reading a book, parents/ caregivers can label the characters’ emotions, point out their facial expressions or ask their child to label the characters’ feelings. 
 
Parents/caregivers can also help their child identify her own emotions by putting a name to how she is feeling. They can label the emotion she is experiencing and the action or event that triggered it. For example, “It makes you feel really frustrated when your cousin takes your truck. It’s okay to feel frustrated.” Encourage parents/caregivers to have these types of conversations to help normalize and validate emotions. They help their child learn to regulate her emotions and find ways to address them. Children can experience strong emotions, and it’s important for the adults in their lives to support them in calming down so they can talk about how they are feeling and learn to problem solve. 


<in the centre>
Children coming to the centre may not yet know how to identify the emotions they’re feeling. You can support children’s emotional understanding by noticing and naming how the children may be feeling and asking them how they’re feeling throughout the day. You can ask, “How are you feeling?” or make comments such as, “It looks like you might be feeling upset about something.” 
 
You can include material about feelings in daily lessons or include a “feelings wall” with pictures of faces showing various emotions along with a label for each photo. Or, you can do a “mad or sad” sorting activity. Before starting, decide which emotions you want to include; for younger children it is better to choose a few feeling words, such as “happy,” “sad,” and “mad.” For older children, you can include more feelings like frustrated, excited, surprised or scared. Include a bin or envelope for each feeling, labelled with the word and a picture illustrating the feeling. Then provide small cards with faces showing the different emotions. These cards can be photos or illustrations of people or animals showing the emotion. Ask the children to sort the feeling cards into the right emotion bin, talking with them about the different expressions if they struggle. Take time to discuss what might cause these different feelings. You can also model naming emotions by talking about how you are feeling, such as, “I am feeling happy today because we are going to pick berries!” or “I am feeling sad because my favourite mug broke” or “I think I need to take a deep breath and calm down. I’m feeling frustrated because I can’t find the game we were going to play together.”  

<reflection>
How often did your caregivers talk about emotions growing up? 
Why should people care about the emotions of others? 
How do you feel talking about emotions? 
How can you describe emotions using words more detailed than sad, mad and happy?

Draw How You Feel

<index>
NURTURING CARE | 2

<title>
 “You’re pressing very hard with your crayon. Are you feeling upset?”

<tagline>
Provide the child with crayons and paper and encourage him to draw his emotions.

<takeaway>
Children can express and learn about their emotions through drawing.  

<overview>
Creating art can help children interpret their experiences and articulate feelings they might not be able to voice. Through drawing, children can express joy, fear, excitement and pain. Because of its therapeutic effects, drawing can help children regulate their emotions, distract them from unhelpful emotions and help them vent when they are upset. 

<practice>
<in the home>
Explain to parents/caregivers that drawing is most helpful for children when they do it freely, without instructions. Suggest that they provide their child with the necessary supplies to draw. As he draws, the child can be encouraged to think about his creation with open-ended questions about his work and how it makes him feel. Open-ended questions require more than a yes or no answer. They can begin with who, what, where, why or how. For instance, “How would you make this person look happy? How would you make this person look angry?” or “Red is a colour that often represents love and passion. What does it mean to you?” or “Those sharp lines remind me of lightning! How do you feel when you see lightning?” These are all open-ended questions. 

<in the centre>
To help encourage children to think about emotions in relation to art, you can ask them open-ended questions about their art and how it makes them feel. You can talk to them about how certain colours make us feel with a question such as, “You used a lot of red. How does the colour red make you feel?” You can talk to the children about the different lines and shapes in their drawings, asking them if their lines are happy or angry lines. This can be included in a lesson about emotions, where you might set out an invitation for the children to “paint a feeling,” giving the children freedom with what they choose to paint. When they’re finished, you can ask them to name their pictures with a feeling and hang their paintings in the centre with their descriptions included. This highlights the children’s art and social-emotional development.  

<reflection>
What kind of art do you like? How does it make you feel? 
Do you know any artists in your community? How are their emotions reflected in their work?  
How can you bring your child’s attention to the art around him? 
What are some questions you can ask your child to encourage him to think and talk about his artwork and how it makes him feel?

Time In

<index>
NURTURING CARE | 3

<title>
 “You are so upset. Come and sit with me until you feel better.”

<tagline>
Respond to a child’s expressions of emotion by connecting with her. 

<takeaway>
When children get upset or act out, pull them in close and help them process their emotions. 

<overview>
Traditional time outs, in which children are isolated and ignored for unwanted behaviour, can make children feel abandoned, confused and frightened. Children have a hard time learning lessons when they are very upset. So, while time outs can put a momentary end to the unwanted behaviour, they won’t impart long-term lessons.  
 
Time ins, however, bring children in instead of pushing them out. During time ins, the parent/caregiver takes charge, bringing the child close, soothing her and helping her calm down after an outburst. This approach recognises that a child’s negative behaviour stems from being unable to maturely process her emotions. Because children learn best when they are calm and feel safe, caregivers can use time ins to help them learn to regulate their emotions. The more practice children have at working through their emotions when they’re young, the better they will be at coping with their emotions when they get older. 

<practice>
<in the home>
You can talk to parents/caregivers about paying attention to their child when she is overwhelmed by her feelings. She may yell, cry, lash out physically or completely disengage with the people around her. You might want to explain that it’s important for parents/caregivers not to take these behaviours personally; the child has yet to learn to process her emotions. Parents/caregivers can take charge and help their child figure out what’s wrong. Sitting with her as she processes why and how she is feeling these strong emotions and soothing her until she is calm will help. 
 
You can explain to parents/caregivers that their child may not want support right away. It’s okay for them to give her time to work through her emotions on her own. It is not a punishment or a time out. She may want to sit on the other side of the couch from them while she has a good cry. Parents/caregivers can stay close and affirm their child’s feelings, and let her know “I am here whenever you are ready.” 

<in the centre>
You can discuss time ins with the children when they first come to the centre. You can explain what a time in is, what leads to a time in and what a time in looks like. You can think about including a “calming corner” or a “cozy corner” that has items and resources to help children when they are upset or they need a moment. The calming corner can include comfy cushions, sensory bottles, tissues, books, stuffed animals, fidget toys and posters on the wall that show calming activities. You can introduce children to the calming corner before they become upset so they know what it is and how they can use it.  
 
When a child is having a difficult moment, kindly invite her to sit with you to express her feelings and eventually calm down. Sitting with her as she processes how and why she is feeling these strong emotions and soothing her until she is calm will help; this time gives you the opportunity to connect and then address the behaviour. Children may not yet have the words to express what is happening or why the behaviour is occurring. Using a time in to talk about the behaviour and emotions is a way to build on earlier Toolbox cards that focus on labelling and expressing emotions.  

<reflection>
When you feel upset, what strategies do you use to calm down? 
How can you tell when a child is becoming agitated? 
What is the best way to help a child feel calm? Is it the same with your other children?

Practising Empathy

<index>
NURTURING CARE | 4

<title>
 “That was very kind when you helped your sister with her shoe.”

<tagline>
Help a child think about the well-being of others.  

<takeaway>
Through considering the needs and feelings of others, children learn empathy.  

<overview>
As children grow out of toddlerhood, they begin to develop concern for the needs and well-being of others. Parents/caregivers can help children think about ways to support other people’s feelings, which can teach them empathy. Being empathic helps children connect with and help others. An empathic child can understand and communicate another person’s needs and feelings. Such skills will help him develop meaningful and compassionate relationships later in life. 

<practice>
<in the home>
Encourage parents/caregivers to ask their child to think about the needs of others. You can explain that through pretend play, their child can learn to develop empathy. A preschool-aged child will begin playing pretend with cars, dolls and blocks. He will start to create stories about what happens to his characters. Parents/caregivers can ask him something simple during play to help him think about the needs of others, such as, “Your baby got hurt. What could make him feel better?” or “Your dinosaur is hungry. What do you think she feels like eating?” Asking him these types of questions will enhance his play, giving him new scenarios to think about. Talk with parents/caregivers about creating opportunities for their child to practise caregiving. Maybe they want to help put on their baby cousin’s sock or take food to a grandparent or Elder in the community. Providing these opportunities will show them the importance of considering the needs of others. 

<in the centre>
Let the children see you modelling empathic behaviour so they can learn by example. Taking care of something or someone helps them to develop empathy and teaches children to consider the needs of others. Together, talk about how to take care of a new puppy. At home, children may help condition new puppies to become part of the family. By doing this, the dogs were being prepared to join the dogteam. It is important for children to learn about caring for another living thing; this activity allows them to learn how to properly provide food, water, shelter and to build relationships. 

You can also tell stories using puppets to demonstrate the characters being empathic, or use hypothetical situations to get the children thinking about how another person feels, “how would you feel if you weren’t allowed in the sandbox?” Praising empathic behaviour when you see it throughout the day, while reading or playing, and being as specific as possible, is important in encouraging children to practise empathic behaviour themselves. 

<reflection>
What does empathy mean to you? 
When your child is feeling strong emotions, how do you model empathy for him? 
Can you think of a time in which someone showed you empathy?

Humility

<index>
NURTURING CARE | 5

<title>
 “Humility means balance between ourselves and others.”

<tagline>
Help children consider ways to put the feelings and needs of others before their own.  

<takeaway>
Through guidance from parents/caregivers and having it modelled to them, children develop humility. 

<overview>
A humble person recognises that they are not better than anyone else and that everyone has something valuable to offer. Children need guidance to develop humility. They need support to learn to consider the needs and feelings of others before their own. Young toddlers are very egotistical. This means they mainly think about themselves. As they get older, they begin to understand that others also have their own set of wants and needs. They benefit from seeing humility modelled by the parents/caregivers in their lives. 

<practice>
<in the home>
You can suggest that parents/caregivers offer guidance and encourage their child to think about the feelings of others or to remind her not to brag about her accomplishments. When their child is successful at something, she should be given praise for her efforts while being reminded how to be humble about her success. For example, if their child is proud of her artwork, she can be taught humility by recognising the effort she put in, “You worked very hard on that painting.” This helps the child develop a sense of intrinsic pride in her artwork and gives her an honest view of her abilities. If their child’s team wins the dancing competition at a community celebration, parents/caregivers can model how to give feedback, such as, “It was so nice to dance with Sandy!” or “I loved Tia’s dance moves!”  

<in the centre>
You can encourage children to think about the feelings of others in the centre, and remind children not to brag about their accomplishments, especially when another child may not have completed the same task yet. You can ask children to say something they like about another child’s work, such as “I like the way Jenny painted her picture.” 
 
Allow children to see you modelling humility; children are always watching and they will see how you react in challenging situations and how you speak kindly to others in the centre. You can encourage children to admit mistakes and teach them how to apologize when they have hurt someone.

Independent Self-Care

<index>
NURTURING CARE | 6

<title>
 “Can you show me how you brush your teeth before bed?”

<tagline>
Create opportunities for a child to practise taking care of himself. 

<takeaway>
By encouraging children as they undertake self-care without help, parents/caregivers nurture their sense of independence.  

<overview>
As children mature, their desire for autonomy and control over tasks they are familiar with increases. Because they are repeated regularly, self-care routines can be used to support a child’s desire for more independence. With the support of parents/caregivers, children can increase their participation in self-care rituals until they are able to do them without help. As their confidence and competence grows, children will undertake and succeed at increasingly difficult tasks. 

<practice>
<in the home>
You can encourage parents/caregivers to take note of what their child can accomplish on his own and encourage him to take on a little more. If he can pull his zipper down by himself, he might also be able to pull his arms out of his sleeves and hang up his coat. After a meal, suggest that parents/caregivers hand their child a cloth and ask him to wipe his mouth. If he needs help, they can look in the mirror with him and point to his mouth and say, “You still have food next to your mouth. Can you wipe there?” When their child is getting dressed, suggest to parents/caregivers that they lay his pants out in front of him, help him get his feet in the legs and then let him pull his pants up on his own. They will have to constantly re-evaluate how much help their child needs because he will grow and learn quickly. 
 
Talk with parents/caregivers about how children will learn through trial and error. You can remind parents/caregivers to give their child time to try a new task by himself without expecting perfection. They can assist if he needs help rather than do the task for him. It is always best to consider the circumstances under which he is performing the task. If the child is overly tired or hungry, for instance, expectations should be adjusted.  

<in the centre>
You can take note of what the children in your group can accomplish on their own and what they may need help to do, and encourage them to take on a little more. Activities that help children develop and showcase their self-care skills can include having a pretend play area equipped with dolls and/or stuffed animals, pretend clothes, shoes, small brushes and toothbrushes. These materials let children practise independent self-care activities like dressing, putting shoes on and brushing hair using dolls or stuffed animals. You can create a dexterity board with string, laces, zippers and buttons to give the children space to practise the skills that will help them with getting dressed. Praise what they can do and encourage the skills they are working on.  
 
If the centre has a dedicated spot for dishes, when children are done with lunch or snack, ask them to put their dishes away. You can use songs to teach and encourage self-care skills. A song during hand washing, for example, can teach children how long they should wash their hands, or a clean-up song after playtime can encourage children to put their toys away.  Establish regular routines throughout the day to help children anticipate what comes next and practise their independent self-care skills.

<reflection>
How do you care for your own well-being on a daily basis? 
What parts of the child’s self-care routines can he do alone? Which can he do with help? Which is he not yet able to do? 
How can you help him learn new ways to care for himself without doing it for him?

Setting Expectations

<index>
NURTURING CARE | 7

<title>
 “Every day after lunch, we put our plates in the sink.”

<tagline>
Outline the expectations you have for a child and stick to them. 

<takeaway>
Children are more likely to live up to expectations when they are consistent and clear. 

<overview>
Children thrive when they know what is expected of them. To encourage positive behaviours in children, parents/caregivers must set clear limits and model what they expect. Expectations should be consistent so children don’t become overwhelmed or confused. Expectations should be developmentally appropriate so children can succeed.  

<practice>
<in the home>
You can talk to parents/caregivers about having conversations with all the primary caregivers in their child’s life. What behaviours do they expect of her? How are these expectations communicated to her in her day-to-day life? They can ask others for support if some behaviours need adjustment. Suggest that they keep in mind that not everyone will share the same expectations. This is fine as long as caregivers are authentic in their requests; when confronted with different expectations, their child will learn that every parent/caregiver has their own preferences, feelings and tolerance levels.  
 
If parents/caregivers expect tidiness from their child, they can ask her to hang up her jacket on a hook that is at her level every day. They can model the expectation for her and say, “I’m going to hang up my jacket. What should we do with yours? You’re right! We hang up our jacket every day.” These tasks will become routine if their child gets used to them early in life. If parents/caregivers expect kindness from their child, they can consistently remind her to be kind and offer her verbal praise when she is. Clearly explain to her what kindness looks like. If she hits her sibling, she can be reminded, “Manik, please be kind to your sister. You can tell her to stop if she is bothering you.” Remaining consistent is key.  

<in the centre>
With each new group of children, you can go over expectations for the group. You can keep the language around expectations simple so it can be easily understood. If you introduce expectations one at a time, the children won’t get overwhelmed trying to remember too many new rules. If you set the expectation that all coats must be stored on a hook, and give each child their own hook labelled with their name, show them where it is. You can use prompts to help them meet the expectation consistently. You can work with children to create books about the different classroom expectations, placing them in the reading area for everyone to see. You can create a collage of the children performing the classroom’s expectations and hang it on the wall, along with a description of what each child was doing and how it aligns with the classroom expectations and fosters independent self-care. 
 
Sending a handout home with families can help everyone understand what is expected of the children. When a child meets or exceeds your expectations, give her specific praise about her behaviour. For example, if you have an expectation that everyone takes care of the centre and you see a child pick up trash off the floor and put it in the garbage, you can say, “Great job taking care of our centre and throwing the trash away that was on the floor!” Use lots of visual, verbal and physical cues and prompts to help children remember the classroom expectations and the daily routine. These prompts can be physical movements, words, songs or cards hung around the centre.  

<reflection>
What are your family’s or centre’s values? 
What expectations did your parents have of you when you were a child? How did this relate to their values? 
Are other caregivers in the child’s life supportive of your values? 
How can you communicate your values to other parents/ caregivers? How is this different than the way you communicate those values to a child?

What Am I Good At?

NURTURING CARE | 8

<title>
 “You are a very strong hockey player.”

<tagline>
Speak kind and empowering words to a child. 

<takeaway>
Affirmations help raise children’s self-esteem and make them feel valued.  

<overview>
Just as parents/caregivers have an inner dialogue with themselves, so too do children. This dialogue is largely informed by what others say about them. If a child is often told, “You’re being so bad,” he will come to believe that he is bad. Through positive affirmations, parents/caregivers can help ensure that their child’s inner dialogue is positive. Positive affirmations support a child’s self-esteem and help him feel important. Affirmations help children feel safe and appreciated. 
 
To be successful, affirmations must be sincere, specific and without value judgements. They must comment on a child’s behaviour rather than his person. Consistent verbal praise that does not meet these criteria will have the opposite effect on a child, leaving him feeling judged, manipulated or afraid of failure. 

<practice>
<in the home>
You can encourage parents/caregivers to watch as their child pursues his interests and develops his gifts, and affirm his actions by narrating what he is doing and encouraging him with positive reinforcement. This can be done using “I messages,” commenting on a specific behaviour by letting their child know how it makes them feel. For instance, if their child enjoys colouring, they might say, “I am so impressed at the variety of colours you used in your artwork. It makes me feel so cheerful!” If you see his potential as a cook, you might remark, “I think we cooked a great dinner together. I especially loved your idea to add salt to the recipe!”
 
You might want to remind parents/caregivers to avoid value judgements that say “you are good” or “you are bad.” These affect how their child sees himself and might lead him to seek external validation for his behaviour or to be afraid of failure. Instead, focus on the child’s behaviours. For example, they can say, “You never quit until you finish the job!” when a child card worked hard building his block tower.

<in the centre>
Affirm children’s actions by describing their interests, narrating what they are doing and encouraging them with positive reinforcement. If you notice a child’s interest in puzzles, you can tell him, “You put that puzzle together so well. I know you have practised a lot to get better at puzzles. You’re a hard worker. Seeing your finished puzzle makes me feel happy!”  
 
As a group, you can sit with the children in a circle with a ball or a balloon. The first person rolls/tosses the ball/balloon to a friend and gives them a sincere compliment. The child who “caught the compliment” then rolls/tosses the ball to another person, giving them a sincere compliment. This activity teaches both the importance of positive affirmations and also in noticing the good qualities in others.  

<reflection>
How would you describe yourself? How did your self-understanding evolve? 
How is a child unique? 
How do you think a strong self-concept will support children during their school years and into adulthood?

Positive Discipline

<index>
NURTURING CARE | 9

<title>
 “If you don’t put away your toys, they might get lost.”

<tagline>
Set up your child to be able to make the best decisions for herself. 

<takeaway>
Logical and natural consequences are the best way to help a child learn the repercussions of her actions.  

<overview>
“Punishment” refers to the way parents/caregivers instill fear or shame in a child for an undesired behaviour. In contrast, “discipline” refers to the way parents/caregivers teach children through consequences. Positive discipline uses logical and natural consequences to help children learn the repercussions of their actions. They focus on a child’s behaviour rather than on her person. Inuit also use imagination and will tell stories to help encourage positive behaviours in children.
 
Natural consequences to behaviours are the best teachers because, when children are ready, they experiment and learn consequences on their own terms. A natural consequence arises organically from a behaviour and does not need to be enforced by an adult. A natural consequence is most meaningful to a child because she is entirely responsible for it. A logical consequence is enforced by an adult but is nonetheless a causal and predictable outcome of a child’s behaviour. Natural and logical consequences teach accountability rather than shame.

To use positive discipline, parents/caregivers can simply remind their child of the possible consequences of her actions. For natural consequences, they might say, “If you choose not to share with your sister, she may not want to play with you” or “If you run on the ice, you may slip and fall down.” For logical consequences, they might say, “If you do not pick up your toys, you won’t be able to take out any new ones,” or “If you act silly while you’re drinking your milk, you might spill it and have to clean it up.”  An imaginative consequence might be “If you play on your device too long, you might get square eyes.”

<in the centre>
To use positive discipline in the centre, simply remind children of the possible consequences of their actions. For natural consequences, you might say, “If you put too much stuff into your backpack, it may be heavy when you carry it,” or “If you choose not to share with your friends, they may not want to play with you.” The expectations for logical consequences should be told to the children in advance, so they understand what is expected of them. For logical consequences, you might say, “If you continue to leave the line, you will have to walk with a teacher.” 

<reflection>
As a child, what were some of the best lessons you learned? How did you learn them? 
Can you think of a time when you were a child and learned from a natural consequence of your behaviour? What was the result?

Your Name Is Special

<index>
NURTURING CARE | 10

<title>
 “Your name is [name]. You were named after a very capable person.”

<tagline>
Teach a child why his name is special and what things his namesake was known for. 

<takeaway>
A child’s name is one of the many things that make him unique. Understanding the origins of this name, and using his name in a positive way, helps a child to feel seen and confident. It can also help create a future “path” for the child as it sets expectations for character and skill development.

<overview>
Whether spiritual, cultural or otherwise, the meaning of a child’s name is important. When children learn about the special story behind their name, they feel important and seen. Parents/caregivers can also help a child feel special by celebrating his unique gifts. 
 
In some cases, children will have a traditional name, or spirit name. Parents/ caregivers can talk about their child’s name, what it means and why it was chosen. They can highlight the child’s gifts and their connection to their culture and community. Teach a child that his name is meaningful and always use it with respect. Always use his name in a positive and meaningful way.  

<practice>
<in the home>
Encourage parents/caregivers to let their child know about the importance of his name, where it came from, and what it means. Why was this name chosen for their child? What makes this name special?  Share the characteristics of his namesake with the child and which people the name connects him to. Use kinship terms properly to ensure those connections follow him for life. Encourage parents/caregivers to share this story with their child. If parents/caregivers kept a baby book while they were pregnant, they can share this with the child to show them their journey into the world. This will help the child be confident in himself and develop a positive self-concept. Use a special aqaq for your child frequently to build that special relationship. 

<in the centre>
Children’s names hold a lot of meaning for them and it is important to honour a child’s name by using it often and in a positive way. You can incorporate children’s names into activities throughout the day. Activities can include creating a name matching game, where children match pictures of their friends with their names. Their names can be included in music time, such as singing “The Name Game” and putting their names into the song. No matter the activity, children’s names should always be used in a positive, affirming way. 
 
To help encourage children’s unique gifts and interests, you can do activities that allow them to see themselves reflected in the centre. You can dedicate an area to display photos of each of the children, labelling each with their name. You can also ask their parents/caregivers to send in family photos and/or pet photos. Invite the children to create a collage using art materials that includes what they like to do and what they believe they are good at. Hang these collages alongside their names and family photos. Seeing themselves, their gifts, interests and families in the centre will help them feel more comfortable and they will develop a positive self-reference.  

<reflection>
Do you know what your name means? How has your name helped you? 
How was the child’s name chosen? What are some ways you can you share this story with the child? 
How can knowing where their names come from help children?
