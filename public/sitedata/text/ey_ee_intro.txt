Engaging Environments Children depend on the adults in their lives to ensure a safe, manageable and predictable physical space and a consistent schedule. A child’s environment can affect how she responds and behaves in both the home and in a childcare centre. As a child gets older, it is crucial to create a stimulating and safe environment, while paying attention to how the child is acting on her environment. The environment is a multi-sensory experience for children that includes different sights, sounds, smells, tastes and tactile elements. When a child’s learning requires her to use her senses, she develops stronger associations with what she is learning.  Create a positive environment indoors with various sensory elements to help children connect to the space and to the wider world around them. Make time for being outside and exploring nature with children; this is an important way to support their connection with nature, the land, their community and their world. Significant outdoor play has many positive effects on children, including improving their self-regulation, developing their motor skills, stimulating their social skills and promoting their self-confidence and self-efficacy.  Parents/caregivers can create welcoming and enriching environments for children both inside and outside. Incorporate elements of the outdoor environment in the home and in the centre by using natural colour palettes, textures, flowers and art. The Toolbox cards in this section offer suggestions for creating a supportive and engaging environment for children.
