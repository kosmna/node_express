Prenatal, Pregnancy and BirthGiving birth is a life-changing event. Whether it is a woman’s first child or tenth, every delivery is different and each birth brings different challenges and celebrations. All families can benefit from information, services and programs that ensure they are prepared and supported to welcome their new baby. The prenatal period is an ideal time for to start home visits. If you get to know the parents/caregivers during the prenatal period by sharing your experiences and understanding, the relationship you build with them will be stronger when the baby is born. Prenatal development has a direct impact on lifelong learning, behaviour and health. Improving prenatal experiences significantly affects a child’s overall resilience as she grows. The primary neural structures of the brain are formed between conception and birth, and everything that an unborn baby experiences contributes to her developing brain. It is also a time when attachment begins between a mom and her child. All families need support, but some need more than others to cope with or overcome specific challenges or barriers. Prenatal programs can be highly effective because pregnant women are often ready to learn and to change their behaviours or environment to ensure that their child will be healthy and safe. You can help expectant parents/caregivers understand the importance of prenatal development so their baby can have the best possible start in life. Prenatal, Pregnancy and Birth Toolbox cards are written with expectant moms in mind, and therefore have only one practice section, “In the Home.” These cards can still be used in a group setting, such as a prenatal or community group. Whatever the setting, they can be used to support moms and moms-to-be by promoting strategies that encourage a healthy pregnancy, early attachment between mother and child, and a healthy newborn.
