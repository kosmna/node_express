<episode>This Is Your Family<index>Family Well-Being | 1<title>"Your grandpa is excited to meet you."<tagline>Introducing your baby to friends and family will start to build her community and let her know she belongs.<takeaway>Understanding identity starts early. Your baby will start to see herself as part of a bigger community. This builds confidence and resilience.<overview>Identity refers to a child’s sense of self—who she is, what is important to her, where she comes from and what she believes about her own abilities and worth. Family is a baby’s first source of information about who she is and where she belongs. Families have a tremendous influence on a baby’s beliefs about herself. Strong and loving families can help babies develop a positive self-image. As they grow, a positive self-image gives them confidence in their abilities, helps them bounce back when they experience difficulties and makes them feel connected to their family and community.<practice>When Mom is ready, encourage her to help her baby create loving relationships with family and community members. Extended family members can provide her baby with exposure to cultural traditions and language and contribute to building her sense of belonging. If you wish, talk about your own experience building community and relationships.<reflection>How soon are you ready to have visitors? Who are the people most important to you and your family?Who will be a support to you and your baby?Who would you like your baby to feel comfortable with? How do you feel when others hold your baby?<keywords>Father-child; bond; oxytocin; nurturing; love; care; bond; biology; brain; energize; play; activate; balance; connection
<episode>Social Time<index>Family Well-Being | 2<title>"You are not alone."<tagline>Connect with other new moms.<takeaway>Being in a social network takes effort, but it will help you not feel isolated and lonely as a new mom. <overview>Babies and young children are a big responsibility and they take up a lot of time and energy. Connecting with extended family and community helps parents/caregivers build their confidence to be the role models they want to be. Seeking out people who offer mental, emotional or spiritual support can be a big help.<practice>EY drop-in days and sharing circles are offered regularly to families in the Early Years program and are a good place for Mom to make a connection with other families in the community. Take an active role to look for community-based programs and events that are appropriate for Mom and her child or children or for just Mom and Dad. Encourage Mom to plan time to visit with friends and family.<reflection>What topics would you like to cover during sharing circles? Where else in your life can you arrange for social time with other adults?Is there someone you can connect with every day or almost every day?<keywords>Stress; relief; mental; health; mind; body; spirit; breathing; belly; relaxation; music; scan; meditation; visualization; self-massage; self-care; balance; well-being; mindfulness; movement; exercise; yoga; tai chi
<episode>Family Planning<index>Family Well-Being | 3<title>"When is it okay to have sex again?"<tagline>When you feel ready and your bleeding has stopped, you can start sexual activity again.<takeaway>Your body needs time to recover from pregnancy and birth. For your health and for the health of your next baby, it is important to ask your doctor about the right time to plan your next pregnancy.<overview>When a new mom feels ready and her bleeding has stopped, she can start sexual activity again. Not every couple wants to resume sexual activity in the first few months. There are many physical and mental reasons for this. However, it is important for a new mom to know that she can become pregnant again before her menstrual period returns. She can also become pregnant while she is breastfeeding.<practice>Open up a discussion with Mom about her feelings around resuming sexual activity. There are many changes that can affect a new mom during the postpartum period. These include changes in how she sees and feels about her body, vaginal bleeding, vaginal dryness, a sore perineum and exhaustion. A breastfeeding mom might be feeding her baby so often that she does not want to be touched by her partner. She might also have tender nipples and her breasts could leak during sexual excitement. Encourage Mom to talk about these feelings with her partner. Showing tenderness toward each other through hugging, cuddling and kissing will help. Most moms will see their care provider for a follow-up appointment six weeks after the baby is born; this is a good time to have the doctor check how her healing is progressing if Mom is unsure.<reflection>What are ways to enjoy affection without having sex? Do you feel comfortable talking to your partner about your needs?<keywords>Birth; control; injection; male; female; pill; condom; patch; contraception; ring; diaphragm; IUC
<episode>Redefining Relationships<index>Family Well-Being | 4<title>"Now I’m a mom."<tagline>Think about how your baby is changing your relationships with your partner and other family members.<takeaway>Recognise that family relationships change after the birth of a baby. <overview>The transition to parenthood is a big change. The postpartum period is a significant time of adjustment for a mom physically, emotionally and mentally. After the birth of a new baby, parents/caregivers want to feel a close, warm attachment to their baby, but they must adapt to this new and major disruption in their lives. And they must also adapt to major changes in a new mom’s body.<practice>Talk to Mom about how caring for a newborn brings on new feelings and tasks. It is an exciting time. New parents often talk about falling completely in love with their new baby. Discuss how being a new parent is a rewarding but tough job. Talk to Mom about how demanding pregnancy and childbirth are and point out that although she will require recovery time, she must still take care of her baby’s needs. Have an open dialog about how Dad and other family members often struggle with the demands and challenges of a newborn. They must also learn how to take care of the new baby and to support and encourage Mom.<reflection>Do you and your partner agree on your roles as parents? How does your baby affect your relationship with your partner?With your parents?With your other children?<keywords>Father; child; connection; bond; provider; quality; support; well-being; affection; life-long commitment; role model; community; culture; tradition;care; guidance; positive; standard; supportive; healing; trauma; fatherhood; play; child development
<episode>Well-Meaning Advice<index>Family Well-Being | 5<title>"Thank you for sharing your experience."<tagline>Family and friends may have advice on how to be a parent. You decide what is best for you and your baby.<takeaway>Recognise that advice is a form of caring. <overview>Everyone has advice about babies, but parents/caregivers should be allowed to make their own decisions for their child and be supported in those choices.<practice>Talk to Mom about how to manage a lot of advice and information all at once. You may want to suggest to her that it’s a good idea to take advice only from people she trusts. When presented with advice or opinions, she can consider it carefully. Is the advice good for her family? Encourage Mom to trust her gut feeling on what is best for her situation. Although no one is a perfect parent, every parent knows their baby better than anyone else.<reflection>If you’re getting too much information, who is providing it and why? Are you curious to find out more about something a friend or family member told you? If so, what is it?Are these sources reliable or is everyone repeating personal anecdotes or superstitions? What can you say to someone who is giving you advice that you are not going to follow?<keywords>family; doctor; doula; visitor; instinct; trust
<episode>Immunizations<index>Family Well-Being | 6<title>"When does my baby get her needles?"<tagline>Immunizations protect your baby from diseases before they have a chance to make her sick. Talk to your health care provider to find out when your baby’s first vaccinations will begin.<takeaway>Immunization is an essential part of every child’s health. Find out when and where to schedule your baby's vaccinations.<overview>It is important to receive vaccines on time. They help protect children against preventable diseases. Immunization has saved the lives of more babies and children than any other medical intervention. Vaccinations are done on a schedule, when children are 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months and then between 48 months and 6 years.<practice>Tell Mom that the community health centre in her area will have designated times and days when vaccinations will be offered. Vaccinations are free. Explain that her baby will be less upset about getting a needle if she is well rested, fed and content before she gets her vaccine. <reflection>What do you think about immunizations? How do you normally deal with uncomfortable situations?Do you have an example to share that might be relevant? How can you help your baby through her immunization visit?<keywords>Immunizations; hearing; health; providers; disease; vaccine; sick; vision; screening; dentist; vision; Immunizations; health; providers; disease; vaccine;protect; safety; well-being; community
<episode>Grief<index>Family Well-Being | 7<title>"I just lost a close friend."<tagline>Ask for support during difficult times. Visitors can be a form of support as you navigate the ups and downs of grieving.<takeaway>In times of loss, it is healthy to grieve even if you are pregnant or have a baby. It is important to allow yourself to feel a range of emotions during difficult times.<overview>Grieving is not easy for anyone. It is important that parents/caregivers feel supported during this time. It’s okay if some days they can’t feel any happiness about their pregnancy or new child. It is important not to bottle up feelings.<practice>Talk to Mom about the positive ways she can release her emotions. These can include writing, drawing, exercising, listening to music, dancing and talking to friends and family. Seeking support is key. She can surround herself with people who respect her grief. It is a natural process that everyone goes through at some point in their life. The variety of emotions that are experienced can be scary for many people, because they do not feel normal. But grief is a normal process and it is important for adults to treat themselves with sensitivity and care during this time. Crying and finding healthy ways to release emotions is important. Tell Mom to talk to her loved ones or an Elder, or to attend a cultural ceremony in her community.<reflection>Who can you talk to when you are grieving? How do you release emotions when you are grieving?Do you allow yourself to cry?<keywords>Bereaved; grief; mourning; loss; support; community; care; nurturing; understanding; mental; health; mind; body; spirit
<episode>Budgeting<index>Family Well-Being | 8<title>"How can I manage my money?"<tagline>A baby adds a new set of costs and financial priorities for parents/caregivers. Making a budget can help you reduce stress.<takeaway>Creating a plan for your money can help to reduce financial stresses. Preparing a budget ensures that you think about your needs and your baby’s needs in advance.<overview>Making a budget helps new parents/caregivers to understand how much money they have each month and where they will be spending it.<practice>Sit with Mom and fill out a budget sheet. As a Visitor, you can help her see where money comes from on a monthly basis and how it is spent. Talk with Mom about immediate wants and needs and discuss longer-term financial goals and hopes.<reflection>Where do you spend money first when you get paid? What are some new or unexpected costs that come with a new baby? How do you save money?<keywords>stress; family voilence; money; independence; food security
<episode>Preparing for Tough Moments<index>Family Well-Being | 9<title>Always have a way to keep safe. <takeaway>All families have tough moments. In times of difficulties, create plans with people you love and trust so that everyone is safe.<overview>In every case, the work of the Early Years Visitor is to support families and reduce harm. Harm can look different in every circumstance. Visitors go at the same pace as families and can support families to create an environment that is safe and trusting. This is harm reduction: helping to keep families safe.Visitors are here to address families’ needs without condition or judgement. It’s important to recognize how the realities of poverty, class, racism, social isolation, past trauma and other social inequalities affect people’s vulnerability to potentially harmful behaviours, as well as their capacity for coping. Harmful behaviours may include using licit or illicit drugs, family violence or being in unsafe situations. <practice> Focus on building the foundations of an open and trusting relationship with parents/caregivers. Take time to listen, without judgement, to their concerns rather than insisting that anyone change their behaviour. In this way, parents/caregivers will be comfortable coming to you during stressful times. Check in with Mom during your visits. You may want to talk to her about recognizing risky behaviours that could harm her children and family members. Give examples of signs of tension in a home. If Mom has difficulties in her relationships, she may have trouble talking about it. That’s normal. Encourage her to talk to someone who makes her feel comfortable and offer to facilitate a referral, if appropriate. Working with Mom, you can implement harm reduction strategies like creating a network of peer support or providing birth control options. Another strategy you can use is creating safety plans for times of conflict. The point of a safety plan is to reduce the potential for harm to the family.<reflection> What types of behaviours may be considered risky or harmful to parents/caregivers or children?What types of behaviours suggest the need for a safety plan?What ways can you think of preparing for safety?Is there anything that is worrying you about this topic?What help do you need to make a plan?Can you think of support people that might be willing to help?<keywords>family violence; stress; safety; safety plan; preparing; harm reduction
<episode>Respectful Relationships<index>Family Well-Being | 10<title>Think about the kinds of relationships you want your baby to experience. <takeaway>Respectful relationships help you and your baby feel safe, valued and happy. <overview>Relationships with partners, friends and family can be both incredibly rewarding and challenging. With time, relationships change. While it’s normal to have disagreements, Mom should feel respected in her relationships so that her and her baby can thrive. Respect is key to healthy relationships. In healthy, respectful relationships, a person trusts that they won’t get hurt emotionally, physically, financially or in any other way. <practice>Sometimes it’s hard to figure out if a relationship is healthy or unhealthy. It may be easier to look at elements of power and control. All families share power and control in different ways and it’s good to reflect on these dynamics sometimes. Ask Mom to think about the good relationships she has experienced. What made them feel good? How could she tell they were respectful? Did Mom feel like she had equal power? Did Mom still feel like she was in control of her life? What were her favorite aspects of these relationships? How can she model them for her baby? If Mom is experiencing unsafe power dynamics or difficulties in a relationship, she may feel shame and not want to talk about it. She may worry about keeping her family together or want to protect the other person. Conflict occurs in all relationships and is a natural result of stress and tension. Explain to Mom that these feelings are normal. Encourage her to talk to her support network or to a professional who could offer advice and guidance. <reflection>What are the strengths of your familial and romantic relationships?Have you found that your relationships have changed?In what ways have the relationships closest to you gotten better? In what ways have they become more strained?Do you feel safe in all of your relationships? If not, what happens that makes you feel unsafe?<keywords>family voilence; education; informed choice; safety plan; partner;
