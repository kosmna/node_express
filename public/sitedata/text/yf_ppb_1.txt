<episode>Starting the Conversation<index>PRENATAL, PREGNANCY AND BIRTH | 1<title>"I’m pregnant."<tagline>You just found out you are pregnant. What now?<image>card_yf_ppb_1_1<takeaway>There’s a lot to think about and a lot to learn. A Visitor can help you find the information you need and can answer your questions and concerns as you learn about becoming a mom.<overview>Women and their families benefit when they have access to parenting information and resources as soon as they know a baby is on the way. Sometimes they need help finding the tools and resources available in their community.<practice>As a Visitor, you can help guide parents/caregivers through the process of finding experts and resources during pregnancy, birth and as their child grows.A great way to help Mom think about motherhood is to review the material Healthy Parents, Healthy Children. You and Mom can review the first part of the book together, discuss websites offering pregnancy information and talk about the various community supports that she can reach out to.Suggest that Mom download one of the many free apps that provide information on the physical and emotional changes a child goes through as she grows in her mother’s womb. Help Mom make a list of services available in her community. If possible, you can visit community services together to learn what is offered.<reflection>Do you know any moms you admire?Do you have any parenting role models?What supports do you have around you?Who can you ask to support you?How will you support your baby’s development in all areas?What teachings do you know about pregnancy?Who can help you learn more about your role as a guide for your baby throughout her life?<keywords>Parenting; partner; relationship; expectations; planning; birth; family; feeding baby; breastfeeding; formula; labour; prenatal; support; community; choice<episode>A Healthy Pregnancy<index>PRENATAL, PREGNANCY AND BIRTH | 2<title>"Have regular prenatal check-ups."<tagline>Keep a calendar of prenatal appointments.<image>card_yf_ppb_1_1<takeaway>Regular prenatal care contributes to a healthy child.<overview>Regular check-ups with a doctor, midwife or nurse practitioner during pregnancy are important for the health of the pregnant mom and her newborn. A woman can schedule a prenatal check-up as soon as she suspects or knows she is pregnant.<practice>As soon as Mom knows she is pregnant, you, as a Visitor, can encourage her to make an appointment with her local obstetrician. To help her prepare for that appointment, you could explain that the appointment will likely include a lot of questions about her medical history and possibly a pregnancy test, pelvic exam, Pap smear, blood test, urine test and blood pressure measurement. By drawing from your own experience, you can explain how these tests work.Most women have about seven prenatal care appointments during pregnancy. Encourage Mom not to miss any appointments. As soon as she decides on a doctor, midwife or nurse practitioner to follow her through pregnancy, she can start building a relationship with that health professional. If you wish, discuss your own relationship with your health practitioner. You can explain that a strong relationship could result in Mom’s desires and needs being better understood from the beginning. You may explain that when a mom has good communication with her practitioner, it often helps her feel more confident and relaxed throughout her pregnancy.<reflection>Will you choose a doctor, midwife or nurse practitioner?What are some questions you can ask at your next prenatal appointment?How will you get there?Who will come with you?Did you feel heard and supported during your appointment?Wellness involves the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual self.

Early nurturing, care, positive experiences and a secure parental attachment are important to both the child and her mom. These have a positive effect on a child’s health, learning and behaviour later in life.<practice>Explain to Mom that her relationship with her child can begin now, as she interacts with her belly, talking and playing intentionally and respectfully. Encourage her to stimulate her child’s senses with new sounds, objects and foods. If you wish, you can talk about your personal experience with pregnancy and ask Mom how she senses the baby communicating with her. Is her baby active at certain times of the day? Talk to Mom about how she wants to connect to her child and to meet her child’s need for a reliable, safe and secure environment.<reflection>What do you already know about your child’s development?How were you shown love as a child?How will you show your child love? How do you already show her love?<keywords>Parenting; love; support; environment; relationships; parent-child; serve & return; interactions; language; reading; brain development; fear; eye contact<episode>Learn About Prenatal Development<index>PRENATAL, PREGNANCY AND BIRTH | 4<title>"How is my baby growing?"<tagline>Trimester 1 (conception to 16 weeks): Many parts of the body are formed. Trimester 2 (16 weeks to 28 weeks): Movement, seeing and hearing begin. Trimester 3 (28 weeks to 36–40 weeks): Most organs are fully developed.<image>card_yf_ppb_1_1<takeaway>It takes about 40 weeks for a full-term baby to develop from a sperm and an egg.<overview>Understanding how a single fertilized egg develops into a newborn child can help a parent realize how vital the prenatal environment is. Even while still in her mom’s belly, a child will respond to what her mom hears, smells and feels.<practice>You can start by talking to Mom about the parts of a baby’s body and brain that develop in each trimester. Explain that during the second trimester, her baby starts to absorb information through her senses. For example, a baby’s hearing develops in the second trimester, so this might be a good time for Mom to pray out loud, sing, drum or listen to music. She will likely want to know that her child will remember her experiences with music and will show a preference for the songs she heard before birth. She may be interested to know that if she takes the time to relax and focus on good feelings during her pregnancy, her child will remember those feelings after she is born.<reflection>What do you know about prenatal development?What trimester are you in?Do you feel the baby?Have you had any pregnancies before?What are you most excited about?Do you have any questions or curiosities that I can help you look into?<keywords>Second trimester; health; planning; discomforts; concerns; supplies; Third trimester; Brain; development; neurons; cells; proliferation; migration; induction; synaptogenesis; myelination; week 1- 12; Sonogram; baby; somersault; womb; nature; nurture; environment; adaptation; fetal; fetus; windows of sensitivity; resilience; vulnerability; epigenetics; adversity; positive; relationships<episode>Roots and Wings<index>PRENATAL, PREGNANCY AND BIRTH | 5<title>"What are my hopes for my baby?"<tagline>Think about your childhood. What do you want your child to experience?<image>card_yf_ppb_1_1<takeaway>Thinking about your child’s future helps you make positive choices now.<overview>Attachment starts well before the birth of a child. It begins with a mom looking after herself while she is pregnant. A pregnant woman can use this time to focus on connecting with her baby physically and spiritually. When moms understand the influence they have, they will feel empowered.<practice>If you wish, you can share your own birth story or talk about stories you have heard with Mom. She may welcome your help to find grandmothers or other women to share knowledge about the ceremony of birth. Creation stories hold many teachings that Mom may connect with. She may benefit from creation stories that encourage Moms to model themselves after Mother Earth, and to understand that they themselves are beautiful and sacred and need to be taken care of.Explain that a child feels everything Mom feels. This sets the stage for strong development. You may want to discuss the honour of motherhood, drawing from your own experiences. Her child’s spirit chose her parents as the perfect people to guide her on her life path. Helping Mom understands the value of building a strong connection with her child will help her child have a good start in life.<reflection>Are there any teachings you remember about raising children?Are there traditions you would like to incorporate in your child’s life?Do you have any interest in learning more?<keywords>Child; development; brain; senses; practices; teaching; tradition; singing; song; culture; drum; connection; support; parent-child; attachment; secure; goals; goal setting;<episode>Prenatal Nutrition<index>PRENATAL, PREGNANCY AND BIRTH | 6<title>"What should I be eating?"<tagline>Now is the time to make healthy food choices.<image>card_yf_ppb_1_1<takeaway>Healthy eating during pregnancy is important for your health and the health of your developing baby.<overview>Pregnant women should eat a variety of nutritious foods, including fruits, vegetables, meat or other proteins and whole grains.<practice>Look at nutrition guidelines and discuss different food groups with Mom. You may decide to take a trip to the grocery store with Mom to discuss how to choose healthy items when shopping. Suggest that she take prenatal vitamins, which can help supplement nutrients that contribute to a healthy pregnancy. Explain that some vitamins, such as iron and calcium, are found in foods that might not be available to her or that she may not find appealing. In this case, prenatal vitamins can help. Explain that these vitamins are covered by healthcare benefits if she gets a prescription from a healthcare provider. Discuss the price of healthy foods and talk about whether cost is an obstacle for her.<reflection>What are your favourite foods?Where do you grocery shop?What are the things you know you’ll buy every time you grocery shop? (Point out positive eating habits that Mom already has.)What foods do you think are best for baby?<keywords>Prenatal; healthy; nutrition; physical; intellectual; fetal; development; food; alcohol; habits; servings; diet; First Nations; Metis; active; budget; healthy; mind; body; spirit; nutrition; canning; 0-6 years;  preservation; milk; substance; breastfeeding; formula; milestones; child; development; parenting; support; community; safe; resources; prenatal; postnatal; sleeping; check-up; tradition; culture; Land; health; mind; body; spirit; nutrition; natural; Mother Earth; active; colonialism; sedentary; villages; food; hunting; fishing; budget; costs; First Nations; tradition; culture; garden; sustainable;<episode>Talk to Your Unborn Baby<index>PRENATAL, PREGNANCY AND BIRTH | 7<title>"My grandmother used to sing this song to me."<tagline>Sing songs and talk to your developing baby.<image>card_yf_ppb_1_1<takeaway>Your baby can hear you when she is still in the womb. This is how her language skills begin to develop. Your child will recognise and respond to your voice when she is born.<overview>Unborn babies can hear sounds and see light and shadows from the time they are about 24 weeks old. Moms get excited about prenatal milestones, especially if they learn that their unborn baby can hear their voice. Unborn babies can also respond to touch, light and taste. Knowing this can help a mom build a bond with her unborn baby.<practice>Suggest to Mom that she pay attention to what her baby is doing when she is in a quiet and relaxing environment. Is her baby moving, kicking or turning over? If she is comfortable with it, you can try singing out loud to the baby while rubbing Mom’s belly. Did the baby’s movements change? This might be one of Mom’s first baby–mom interactions; an early "serve and return.” Some other options are to drum, shake a rattle, dance or speak to her in a traditional language. Pay attention and see if there is a response.<reflection>Do you notice how the baby’s movements change, depending on your activity?Does your baby get excited or respond with movements when she hears or feels something in particular?<keywords>Infant memory; mother-child connection; prenatal; reading; connection to Mother Earth; learning in the womb; language; attachment; bonding<episode>Friends and Family<index>PRENATAL, PREGNANCY AND BIRTH | 8<title>“Could you please pick me up some tea and cookies when you go to the store today?”<tagline>Ask for help and support from family and friends.<image>card_yf_ppb_1_1<takeaway>Parents need support from each other and from all generations of their family and community. Grandmothers, aunties and good friends can be a big help during pregnancy and childbirth and after the baby arrives.<overview>When a woman shares the news of her pregnancy, her friends and family often say they will help with whatever she needs; all she has to do is ask, they tell her. However, for a variety of reasons, sometimes an expectant mom is reluctant to ask for help.Strong social networks and a sense of belonging are key to nurturing healthy coping strategies that can help moms manage stress during pregnancy.<practice>As a Visitor, you may want to encourage Mom to recognise sources of strength in her life that are meaningful, like grandmothers and other family members. She may need a little help to feel good about drawing on the gifts her supporters can offer.<reflection>Who else is excited about your pregnancy?Who is close to you that can be a reliable support?How can you ask for more support from a family member or friend?<keywords>Healthcare; grandmothers; relationships; community; prenatal health; breastfeeding; tools; support; empowering; resources; knowledge; culture<episode>Self-Care<index>PRENATAL, PREGNANCY AND BIRTH | 9<title>"I matter."<tagline>Name some of the things you do to take care of yourself, like get enough rest, eat healthy, exercise, take warm baths, listen to music and read.<image>card_yf_ppb_1_1<takeaway>When a pregnant woman takes care of herself, she is also taking care of her developing baby.<overview>Moms-to-be have many emotions and not all of them are happy. Almost all pregnant women feel sad or worried to some degree during their pregnancy; this is normal and healthy. Some of these feelings can be caused by normal physical and hormonal changes that take place during pregnancy. Eating well, getting some form of exercise and connecting with her community network can all help a pregnant woman cope with her emotions.<practice>For some moms, taking time to be totally alone is just as important as developing a strong support network. To help Mom recognize what she needs most, try asking her to make a list of things she likes to do and things that make her feel safe and comfortable. Discuss what she put on her list. Talk about her feelings and who is in her life to support her. You may want to draw from your own experience and tell her how you related to others. Remind her that for the first few weeks, a mom’s only job is to support her child. Her network is there to help.<reflection>What do you love to do alone? With others?What will it be like doing those things when you have baby to care for?How can you plan time to take care of yourself?What are some quick, easy ways to get exercise during and after your pregnancy?<keywords>Healthy; active; pregnancy; outdoors; nutrition; balance; well-being; mind; body; spirit; work; relationships; strategies; self-care; negative coping; emotions<episode>Managing Stress<index>PRENATAL, PREGNANCY AND BIRTH | 10<title>"How do I relax?"<tagline>Make time for yourself every day by walking, reading, taking a bath or taking a nap.<image>card_yf_ppb_1_1<takeaway>Lowering your stress calms your developing baby.<overview>When a pregnant woman is stressed, her unborn baby becomes stressed. Stress and pregnancy both use a lot of energy. Being tired can lead to even more stress and that can become a difficult cycle to break. Constant stress can increase the chances of an early labour or a baby with a low birth weight. Learning to cope with stress during pregnancy can help a mom develop coping skills for the normal, everyday stresses of being a new mother. It will also give her more day-to-day energy.<practice>Working together with Mom, find community resources to help her reduce stress. You can help her make a list of ways to manage stress. Consider parent groups, going for walks together and grocery shopping.<reflection>How can you calm down?What routines can you put in place to help relieve stress every day?What resources or supports are around to help you?What are some situations that you know will cause you stress?What can you do to prepare yourself to cope with these situations?<keywords>Prenatal; stress; child; development; intergenerational; epigenetics; physiology; pregnancy; cortisol; brain; mother-child; Neuroscience; adversity; gene expression;   perinatal; vulnerability; mental health; behavioural problems; toxic; chronic; abuse; neglect; fight or flight; responsiveness; nurturing; love; support; community; trauma; parent-child; ACE;<episode>Thinking About Breastfeeding<index>PRENATAL, PREGNANCY AND BIRTH | 11<title>"Should I nurse my baby?"<tagline>Consider the benefits and the challenges of breastfeeding your baby.<image>card_yf_ppb_1_1<takeaway>Breast milk contains vitamins and nutrients that your baby needs to be healthy. Breastfeeding is the healthiest choice for your baby and it has benefits for you too.<overview>When breastfeeding a baby, a mom passes on her natural immune defenses against infections and disease. Breast milk is easy to digest, free and readily available. It does not require bottles, sterilization or a trip to the store. Breastfeeding has been shown to decrease a mom’s risk of cancer and postpartum depression. It also helps a mom lose pregnancy weight and form a strong bond with her infant.Some moms have no problems breastfeeding, but others face physical challenges, including sore, cracked and/or dry nipples; blocked ducts; inverted nipples; and difficulty helping premature babies learn to breastfeed. Sometimes it can take up to a month—or longer—for a mom and her child to get comfortable with breastfeeding.<practice>If you have experience with breastfeeding, you can explain to Mom that it has many benefits but is not always as easy as it looks. Share your experience. Explain that every mom has a different experience with breastfeeding and that every baby is different. One baby might breastfeed easily, but another might not latch on to the breast.Tell Mom you can help her find support if she faces breastfeeding challenges. Find out if there are lactation consultants or other supports in the community.<reflection>Have you breastfed before?Is there a comfortable place in your home for breastfeeding?How do you feel about breastfeeding?What teachings do you know about breastfeeding?What other options are available for you?<keywords>Breastfeeding; health; nutrition; well-being; benefits; child; development; mother-child; connection; bond; growth; weight loss; budget; support; community; tradition; natural; attachment; pregnant; nipples; pregnancy; nursing bra; milk; alcohol; drugs; the Creator; health; brain; development; milk; connection; bond; mother-child; comfort; love; safety; formula; budget; myths; diet; fish broth; smoking; oxytocin; community; father; mind; body; spirit<episode>Space for Baby<index>PRENATAL, PREGNANCY AND BIRTH | 12<title>"Where will my baby sleep?"<tagline>Create a welcoming space in your home for your newborn child.<image>card_yf_ppb_1_1<takeaway>Preparing the house for your newborn is a good way to connect with your child while you are still pregnant.<overview>Creating a cozy, safe space for a newborn helps make it easier to breastfeed, care for and bond with her. It also helps a mom and her child build strong connections with all family members.<practice>Explain to Mom that adult mattresses are not built for babies; they are too soft. Tell her that the best place for a newborn to sleep in the first 6 months of life is in the same room as Mom but in a separate, safe place, like a crib. Explain that sharing a room can reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and makes it easier to breastfeed.Explain that it’s important to always place the newborn on her back when she takes a nap and goes to bed at night. This is the safest way for the baby to sleep.<reflection>How can you make sure that your baby is safe and feels secure while sleeping?What has your family used in the past?<keywords>ABC's; alone; back; crib; safe sleep; safety; SIDS; bedsharing; crib; co-sleeping; benefits; risks; Bedsharing; co-sleeping; breastfeeding; SIDS; ABC's; death; risks; mattress; alcohol; exhaustion; Nature; Creator; Mother Earth; song; Cree knowing and being; gift; spirit world; spirit to child; spirit blanket; rocking; water spirit; placenta; moss bag; swing; spine, nervous system; muscular strength; swing; spirit to child transition; balance; moving; safe; protection; loved; Moss bag; healing; protection; safe; smell; sight; hear; traditional roles; carrying child on back; awareness; looking out; Safe sleep; safety; SIDS; bedsharing; crib; co-sleeping; benefits; risks; gifts; Creator; Safe sleep; safety; SIDS; bedsharing; crib; co-sleeping; benefits; risks; gifts; Creator; support; community; mother-child; smoking; breastfeeding; mother-child; parent-child; colic; spitting up; alcohol; sleep surfaces; crib; swaddle; purple crying; Safe sleep; safety; SIDS; bedsharing; crib; co-sleeping; benefits; risks; gifts; Creator; support; community; mother-child; smoking; breastfeeding; mother-child; parent-child; colic; spitting up; alcohol; sleep surfaces; crib; swaddle; purple crying;<episode>Dressing Baby<index>PRENATAL, PREGNANCY AND BIRTH | 13<title>"What should my baby wear?"<tagline>Think about the basic items your newborn child needs to be safe, warm and comfortable.<image>card_yf_ppb_1_2<takeaway>Dress your child appropriately for each season so she does not get too cold or too hot.<overview>Until a child is about 6 to 12 months old, she might need some help regulating her body temperature. This depends on baby’s weight; if she is little, she might need to wear more layers. Skin-to-skin time with a newborn helps her regulate her body temperature. Adults are able to adjust their body temperature to their environment; however, because the baby was in a womb at the perfect temperature for so long, her body needs some time to learn to do this on her own.<practice>Explain that it’s a good idea to dress a newborn in the same number of layers that Mom is wearing, then add one more layer. However, it’s important to try not to overdress her. If possible, Mom should keep the house between 20.0 °C and 23.8 °C during the day. At night, the house should be no cooler than 16.0 °C. Premature babies may need yet another layer of clothing until they reach their full-term due date. Explain to Mom that on hot days in the summer, when adults are wearing short sleeves, a newborn should be protected from the sun’s UV rays by keeping her in the shade or dressing her in loose, light fabrics to cover her skin. She should always be wearing a hat to protect her head from the sun.When a baby goes from outside to inside on a cold day, Mom may want to remove a layer of clothing, even if her newborn is asleep. To make this easy, the best trick is to dress the child in light clothes and layer her in blankets or a warm car-seat cover that is easy to remove. Body heat is lost quickly when a child is not wearing a hat, so it’s important to make sure she wears a warm hat on cold days.Explain to Mom that the best way to check a child’s temperature is by feeling her chest, back or neck. She can reach two fingers into the collar of her child’s snowsuit to feel her temperature. Remind Mom that she should trust her instincts when looking for signs. If a child’s skin is beet red, she has a pin-point rash or is hot to the touch, it might be a good idea to remove a layer or two. If a child is overheating, she can be difficult to wake up, unresponsive and could start vomiting.<reflection>How can you tell if your child is comfortable?During what month will your child be born?What can you have ready for the season?Do you need to reach out to any resources for items that you don’t have access to?Do you need my support to get these items or can you do it yourself?<keywords>How to dress; clothing; newborn; layers; car seat; safety; blankets; overheating; temperature; sun; sewing;<episode>Baby on the Move<index>PRENATAL, PREGNANCY AND BIRTH | 14<title>"My baby needs to be safe when we go places."<tagline>The safest way for a child to travel in a car is in a car seat.<image>card_yf_ppb_1_2<takeaway>The right sized seat, proper installation and the right clothing will ensure a child is safe in a car no matter what.<overview>Always put a newborn in a child safety seat. Holding her, even when a car is travelling at slow speeds, is not safe. A newborn’s head is large and heavy and her neck muscles are weak. She needs a car seat to give her proper support. It is recommended that children use a rear-facing child safety seat for as long as possible. In most provinces and territories, children must ride in a car seat until they are at least 5 years old or more than 40 pounds. Children 8 years and younger must ride in a booster seat until they are at least 4 feet 9 inches tall or 80 pounds.Provincial laws in Canada require that proper rear-facing child safety seats be used. To install a child safety seat, follow the manufacturer’s instructions and the vehicle owner’s manual.<practice>There are a lot of infant car seats on the market and parents/caregiviers may find it difficult to know which one to choose. As a Visitor, you can support parents/caregivers by shopping for a car seat with them or by doing an online search together with them during a visit. Explain the two-finger rule. A car-seat strap should buckle snuggly on a child’s body with just enough room to fit two adult fingers underneath. The buckle itself should be above her stomach and below her neck at about nipple height.You can discuss how to prepare a child for a car seat. When she is in the car seat (especially in the winter), it is important that she is dressed in fitted clothing. If she is wearing a puffy jacket under her car-seat straps, there will be extra space between her chest and the straps, which leaves room for her to move forward; this could cause harm in the event of an accident. Instead of a jacket, suggest that once the child is seated snuggly in her seat, Mom add extra blankets to keep her warm.<reflection>What is your most frequent mode of transportation?How can you access what you need to keep baby safe?<keywords>Car seat; safety; buckling; seat; belt; buckle; travel<episode>Birth Plan<index>PRENATAL, PREGNANCY AND BIRTH | 15<title>"Where am I going to deliver my baby?"<tagline>Have a birth plan conversation with your doctor, midwife or community healthcare team.<image>card_yf_ppb_1_2<takeaway>A birth plan lets the medical team know your concerns and preferences in advance.<overview>Deciding how and where to give birth helps a woman feel in control of the delivery. She should make as many important decisions as possible before she goes into labour. A mom should explain her plans to the people around her so that others will know the plan and advocate for her if she cannot explain it during delivery.<practice>Sit with Mom to discuss her birth plan, where the delivery will take place and who will be in the room. Talk about how she will get to the hospital and what she should take to the hospital. Take stock of all the people who know about the birth plan and who can be trusted to make decisions if there is an emergency. You may want to suggest writing a list of questions to bring to medical appointments so that all of Mom’s questions can be answered by a healthcare provider.Talk about your experience and what you know about pain medications or options that Mom may wish to use during birth. You might want to explain that it’s a good idea to decide on these things before going into labour because things do not always go exactly as planned.Together with Mom, you may want to look for information on local prenatal classes. You and Mom can look at the schedule of classes. It’s a good idea to have the phone number for your local maternal child health nurse on hand. She may become an important resource for you, Mom and the rest of the family.<reflection>If you have had a baby before, what went well that you would like to ensure happens again?What would you like to do differently?If this is your first baby, what do you know about the birth process?Where can you find more information, if needed?What teachings about birth do you know?<keywords>Community; sacred; teachings; respect; bond; mother-child; connection; placenta; water; life; pregnancy; buried; connection to Mother Earth; Birth; plan; prepare; labour; hospital; pain; role; delivery; feeding; tradition; medical; Hospital; bag; items; clothes; baby; contractions; car seat; Tradition; midwife; moss; placenta; cradleboard; labour; birth; health; active; Elders; hospital; knots; sacred; nature; nutrition; community<episode>Birth and First Nation Government Registration<index>PRENATAL, PREGNANCY AND BIRTH | 16<title>"My baby is part of my community."<tagline>Every baby has a right to an identity.<image>card_yf_ppb_1_2<takeaway>First Nation Government registration confirms a child’s rights as a member of her Nation. Birth registration confirms a child’s rights as a citizen of Canada.<overview>A child’s birth registration is the official recognition of her birth and her identity as a Canadian citizen. Birth registration ensures that a child has access to government programs, including health care, education and social services.A First Nations child also has the right to be registered with her First Nation Government, which acknowledges her status as member of her community. First Nation Government registration entitles her to a range of benefits and services provided by the Nation. It also entitles her to benefits and services provided by federal and provincial governments. Every child born in Canada must be registered provincially or territorially before applying for a birth certificate. The birth registration is done at the hospital.<practice>Once the newborn comes home, you can explain the process and help Mom apply for a birth certificate with her local registry agent.

The more prepared a woman is mentally, the less stressed she will feel in the moment.<image>card_yf_ppb_1_2<takeaway>An expectant mom might have some fears or anxieties about giving birth. Talking about these before she goes into labour can help her feel mentally prepared for the experience.<overview>Unexpected things can happen during labour and delivery. Thinking about an upcoming birth and talking to someone about it before it happens is a good way for expectant parents/caregivers to prepare mentally.<practice>Talk to Mom and Dad about the process of giving birth. Allow them to take turns expressing fears and listening to each other. Naming and expressing anxieties is a good way for Mom and Dad to let go of them. You may want to ask Mom to explain what she hopes will happen during the birthing process. She may find it reassuring if you remind her that her body is designed to give birth to a child.<reflection>What excites you when you think about giving birth?Do you have any anxieties about labour and delivery?

Becoming a mom for the first time can be an adjustment. Taking the time to talk about the experience with someone who can relate might be healing.
