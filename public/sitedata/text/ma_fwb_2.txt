Notice the parts of your baby's personality that make her unique.

<takeaway> Finding ways to strengthen your baby’s gifts helps parents/caregivers guide her to fulfil her life’s purpose. 

<overview> One of the main tasks of parents/caregivers is to get to know their baby to help her build on her gifts and to support her in the other areas in which she needs support. By trying to unravel a baby’s gifts, parents/caregivers can help her to develop positive self-esteem. How a baby feels about herself translates into what she believes she is capable of accomplishing.

<practice> Encourage Mom to spend uninterrupted quality time with her baby and to observe her in play. While watching her, see which toys she plays with often and where her talents lie. At this stage in her life, she is beginning to show personality traits that make her an individual. This can include having likes and dislikes, favourite items, interests and capabilities. Mom can ask herself, "What makes my baby unique?”

It is important that her baby is part of a community. Her gifts might lie in an area her parents/caregivers are not skilled in. Mom might find a friend, family member or Elder who can help to support her baby’s gift. For example, if her baby loves drumming but her Mom doesn’t know many songs, it’s a good idea to find someone who can spend time with her, singing and drumming.

Other gifts will become obvious through play. If she is always playing with baby dolls, her gifts might involve parenting, teaching or healing one day. Mom can nurture her baby’s gifts by providing her with opportunities to explore them. When she plays with her dolls, Mom can offer her blankets, baby clothes, spoons and bowls so she can further her interest in babies.

A baby with a gift for expression and emotion might struggle with how do deal with her gift when she is a toddler. While she is young her gift might manifest as outbursts or tantrums but she might become a talented artist, poet or musician in adulthood. Mom can help guide her baby by modelling appropriate ways of dealing with emotions and effective ways of expressing them. Mom can help her baby express emotions through art, song or physical activity.

<reflection>

"Who are the important men in my baby’s life?"

<tagline>
Think about who the positive role models are for your child.

<takeaway>
Male role models come in many forms, including dads, grandpas, uncles, brothers and friends. 

<overview>
Men have an important role to play in raising babies. When men are involved in a baby’s life as she grows, she will develop a positive understanding of men and their roles and learn that men can be strong and supportive as well as caring and nurturing. Knowing this will help her form healthy opinions.

Men have different styles of involvement with babies than women do. Women are often more emotional and gentle, whereas men tend to be active and physical. A mix of both these styles work well together for a developing child. Men who have not been shown love in their past might have a hard time opening up to their partners or babies. Spending time with a baby helps dads and babies. When people spend time with babies, the level of oxytocin—the hormone that makes you feel happy—in their body increases. This can reduce a person’s depression. Over time, it also helps men become more nurturing and in tune with their own emotions. As a result, they become more responsive to their baby’s needs. Men will want to be involved with the baby more when they see that the baby is comforted and calmed by their actions.

<practice>
It takes time to learn how to be a good dad or male role model for a baby. Talk to Mom about who will take on this role and how they can be involved in her baby’s life. Anyone who is new to spending time with her baby will need support. Tell Mom that the men involved in her baby’s life are welcome to use the EY Toolbox cards. Tell her to encourage the men in her child’s life to take part in caregiving routines. When they change diapers, prepare meals or dress her baby, they are creating a strong bond with the baby.

Discuss with Mom that a baby needs time with parents/caregivers more than fancy clothes. Encourage Mom to think about ways that the men in her life can spend quality time her baby. They can sit on the floor and play, go for walks or read books together. When her baby spends time with a male role model who is genuine, it will create special moments that her baby will remember.

<reflection>
Who were the important men in your life? 
How were they involved?
What did they teach you?
What are your initial feelings about men being involved in your child’s life?
If Dad cannot be there, who can have a kinship relationship with your child to provide positive male influence?

"I know what’s best for my child."

<tagline>
Be the voice your baby needs when she cannot speak for herself.

<takeaway>
Learn as much as you can about your baby's development. Know who to ask for help when you or your baby need support. 

<overview>
Babies do not have the voice or the insight to fight for what they need. They rely on their parents/caregivers to speak for them. 

<practice>
Encourage Mom to learn about her child’s development and find out about the supports and services available to the whole family. There are many different times during a baby’s life when Mom needs extra support. Dealing with service providers can become overwhelming or stressful and can cause Mom to "check out.” As a Visitor, you can give her the tools she needs to be an effective advocate. This will ensure that her baby’s needs are met. It will also give Mom the confidence to handle similar situations in the future. By becoming educated and practising advocacy, Mom will begin to feel in control of her own life. This increases her hope for the future and will give her baby an opportunity to model herself after strong family members.

To learn as much as possible about her child, Mom might ask herself, "What do I want for my child?” "What is my child really good at?” and "What is my child still working toward?”

Discuss with Mom how she can open communication channels with people in the community and build relationships between those people and her child. She can start by saying "Hello” or "Good morning” to others in a casual way. When Mom starts to see the positive effects of communication on her baby, she will be encouraged to continue building on it.

Sometimes there are struggles with children that come up repeatedly. Talk to Mom about keeping track of her concerns by making a list. She can then bring the list with her as a reminder when she visits her doctor, social worker or you, her Visitor. She could also ask someone to come to appointments with her to listen and take notes. As a Visitor, you can tell her about the services available and help her prepare for what she will do and say when she uses those services.

You can inform Mom about her rights and what she is entitled to. As a Visitor, you can help build a strong support system around the family that will help Mom understand what she needs so she can speak up for herself and her family.

<reflection>
What are your first feelings when you speak to someone about your child’s needs? 
What can help you to feel confident and effective?
Who can you practise with beforehand? How did it go?
What would you like to do differently next time?

Roles and Responsibilities

"You pick up your toys, I will set the table and then we can sit down to eat."

<tagline>
Each adult and child has responsibilities that help maintain your household.

<takeaway>
Your baby will gain a sense of responsibility and pride when she has age-appropriate tasks to complete. 

<overview>
Each member of the family—immediate, extended and kin—have roles to play. For example, a baby puts her toys away, a mom goes to work, big brother picks up his siblings from school and grandpa makes dinner.

While it’s good for children to have time for free play, it is also good for everybody to take ownership of a small piece of the whole family system. This ensures that one person is not responsible for too much of the work. It also builds a sense of responsibility in the children. The family is the centre of a baby’s community. How everyone works together also shows her how things work outside the home.

<practice>
Toddlers enjoy taking part in small chores around the house. Encourage Mom to see what her baby enjoys doing and can do by herself. Tell Mom to be patient and let her baby finish the task. As her baby grows, she will see the people around her working hard to make sure the family is safe, happy and healthy.

Completing household tasks alongside an adult makes them much more fun. Explain to Mom that her baby will enjoy the challenge of bringing plates from the table to the sink or holding the dustpan while Mom sweeps. It can be a lot of fun learning how to fold laundry or to stir the dough for bannock. As her baby grows, some of these tasks will become her regular responsibility. Mom can teach her child how to accomplish tasks so she can do them on her own some day. This will build her pride in her home and family.

<reflection>
What were your household responsibilities as a child? 
How old were you when you started doing them?
How do you feel about your baby taking on responsibilities?
How would you respond if your baby refuses to complete the task?

"I help to guide baby through her life path."

<tagline>
Think about the style of parenting that describes you best.

<takeaway>
Being responsive and setting reasonable boundaries is helpful when parenting. 

<overview>
Often, parents/caregivers raise their children by modelling their own upbringing. All parents/caregivers want the best for their children, regardless of how they express it.

There are two main characteristics that combine to create a parenting style. One is responsiveness, which describes how the adult understands and responds to the child’s needs and interests. The other is boundaries, which are the rules parents have for their children and the way they enforce them. Responsiveness and boundaries exist in every family, but each family, through their individual parenting style, has their own way of responding and setting boundaries.

<practice>
If Mom experienced hardship during her childhood, she will choose to make changes in her own time, when she is fully ready to heal. As a Visitor, your role is to build a strong relationship with her no matter what her parenting style is. Encourage the positive parenting moments you see and build on them. The parenting styles you introduce can provide useful information for Mom; they are meant to encourage her, not to be used to force change.

Suggest that Mom think about her own childhood and how that affects her parenting style. Tell her to reflect on her past by asking, "What do I want to do in the same way my parents did? What would I like to do differently?”

There are many ways to parent. Talking in groups with other parents who have children around the same age can provide insight. Parenting is a lifelong journey. It is full of challenges and celebrations. Mom can share her stories and listen to others. She can also review the parenting styles chart to decide where they fit and set goals for the future.

<reflection>
How have your experiences as a child affected who you are as a parent?
What are your initial reactions when you notice someone parenting their child differently than you? 
How do you work to connect with other parents?

"We are ready to try something new."

<tagline>
Think about the next stages of your life and your baby’s life.

<takeaway>
Decide what steps you will need to take before you go back to work or school. 

<overview>
Families go through various stages in their lives. As children grow, they need new experiences to help them become successful adults. Involvement with larger groups of children and learning how to get along with new people are helpful. A baby is a social being. When she gets close to 24 months, she will want to play with other children. Child care is a good choice; it can meet the child’s needs and make it possible for the family to invest in their own growth. Parents/caregivers can decide what this looks like for them.

<practice>
Discuss with Mom what she thinks the future looks like, both for herself and her family. Sometimes it is nice to write this down or share it with someone she trusts. Mom can ask herself, "What are my goals and how can I get there?” She can break the goal down into small, tangible pieces and ask, "What can I accomplish in a month? Six months? A year?”

Suggest that Mom look for support that will help her accomplish her goals. Does she need to enroll in school, create a resume or find child care? 

<reflection>
What would I like to see for my family in five years? 
What would I like to see for my family in one year?
What steps do I need to take in order to get there? 
What does my timeline look like?
Who can be a support to me and help me accomplish each step?

Adjusting to a New Baby

<index>
Family Well-Being | 7

<title>

"Welcome, baby."

<tagline>
Take care to help your baby adjust to her new role as a sibling.

<takeaway>
With time, your baby will become a proud and helpful sibling. 

<overview>
Until now, the first baby has been the only child who needs attention. Depending on her temperament and age, it can be difficult for her now that she has to share that attention. She has a brand-new role to take on. Being an older sibling helps her start to develop empathy. With some preparation, having a younger sibling can be a very positive experience for her.

It takes some juggling to look after every family member’s needs during this transition time. Thinking through the process helps it to feel less stressful and more manageable.

<practice>
Encourage Mom to prepare her child for the new baby early by having a lot of conversations about what is happening. Mom can help her child to gradually understand the importance of being an older sibling and discuss all the ways she can help. Watching Mom’s belly grow and feeling the newborn kick will help her build a bond with her sibling. She might like to read a book or sing to Mom’s belly. 

Mom can try giving her first child a doll so she can practise putting a diaper on it. She can show her child how to swaddle the doll and take the doll for a walk or feed her a bottle. By reinforcing this behavior, her child will know that soon she will be a big sister and can help Mom do these things with the new baby. While feelings of jealousy are natural, being involved in a new baby’s care will help her feel proud and responsible for her sibling.

Discuss the transitions that need to be made early so that the older child does not experience too much change all at once. Mom might need to make decisions about moving her child to her own bed or might need to figure out how breastfeeding is going to work. If Mom is not comfortable nursing both children, she might want to start weaning her first child as soon as she knows she is pregnant.

Mom should make time for her older child to spend one on one with her Mom or another adult so that she can have individual attention. Once the newborn is home, she will get less attention. This can be difficult for her to understand. If she knows she will read a book alone with Mom every day before bed, she will be less likely to act out to try to get attention.
